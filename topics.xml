          Giant Comet Is Now
          Hurling This Way
          Here's Halley's comet, biggest and rarest of comets, now head
          ed this way. It can be seen now for the first time in 76 years.
          These pictures were taken in 183 G-6, at its last appearance. At the
          left the comet has been visible one month, at the right three
          months.
          Halley's comet, the "evil eye of
          the sky," has Just been sighted by
          astronomers at the Harvard ob
          servatory, and Is bearing down on
          the earth at a rate of several
          thousand miles a second. Its tail
          Is millions of miles long and tin
          comet itself Is bigger than the
          sun.
          Once In every 76 years this
          hobo of the heavens wanders into
          the earth's orbit, leaving a meteor
          shower In Its wake.
          It gets its name from the Sng
          llshman who discovered It In
          1682. Its appearance always has
          been associated with some big
          event In world history, and now it
          makes good Its reputation be
          coming just after the north pole
          Is discovered.
          The comet will be visible with
          good telescopes from all over Unit
          ed States for several months.
          Astronomers' present theories
          about comets make old beliefs
          seem funny. People ÜBed to
          shudder when they dreamed of
          the earth hitting a flying comet.
          Halley's comet ought to be
          more dangerous than the others,
          because It is so big, and gm
          clear out of our whole system of
          planets.
          But the comet is as harmless «c
          an incandescent electric light. 1
          Comets are composed of gab, B
          kind of gas that shines where
          there is no air, just like the elec
          tric light's shining thread does.
          The Harvard astronomers not
          only will look AT the comet with
          their telescopes), but CLEAR
          THROUGHT It. They will even
          jsee stars on the other sides of the
          comet.

          In fact, the comet is a kind of
          giant X-ray, with the vacuum
          ■■mill the planets like Jhe vacu
          um in the glass tube.
          .Many linn-* Hum comet has «i>-
          IM-ared Just before sonic import
          iiiit event in the history of the
          world.
          From what all the ancient star
          .na/.ers have written scientists be
          lieve that Halley's comet was the
          bright light that shone as the star
          <>f Bethlehem.
          In 18:>5 the comet last appear
          ed. People were frightened when
          they rrw the great light in the
          sky, and when the civil war fol
          lowed, many associated the comet
          and the war.
          Halley, who gave the comet Its
          name, prophesied that It would
          appear in 1758. People said ho
          was cra/.y, but he left In his will
          a request that if it appeared when
          he said, he wanted the scoffers to
          remember he was right.
          True to his word, the comet
          came within sight on Christmas
          eve, 1758.
          There will be great sights in
          the sky this winter, for the me
          teors that follow the comet are
          more numerous than those of any
          other sky hobo. The meteors are
          repelled by the sun; consequent
          ly the tail of the comet always
          curves away from the sun. Hal
          ley"s comet will cross the earth
          ahead of our orbit, going toward
          the sun. So when the earth catch
          ?s up with the comet's trail, there
          will be more meteors in our sky
          than there are clams on the sea
          ishore.

          Halley's Comet to Wrap
          Its Tail Around
          This Sphere
          New York, Feb. 1. Camilla
          Flammarion, the French as
          tronomer, in a letter published
          here today, says that the vapo
          rous tail of Halley's comet will
          onvelope the earth on May 19.
          "For several hours," he says,
          "we will be immersed in the
          gaseous caudal appendages
          whose chemical constitution is
          still little known. The comet
          will pass directly between the
          sun and the earth at 2 o'clock
          in the morning of May 19. At
          that hour the Pacific ocean will
          be in full daylight, while in
          France it will be night.
          Little danger may be expect
          ed, however, for the tail will
          probably be so rarified as to be
          inoffensive. Ogden Standard.

          COMET MAY KILL
          ALL EARTH LIFE
          SAYS SCIENTIST
          Cyanogen Gas Around
          The Wanderer Clash
          Among Astronomers
          [Special Dispatch to The Call]
          BOSTON, Mass.. Feb. 7.— A tel
          egram received here today from
          Yerkes observatory states that
          the spectra of Halley's conlet
          shows very prominent cyanogen
          bands.
          The fact that cyanogen is pres
          ent in the comet has been com
          municated to Camille Flamma
          rion, the distinguished French
          scientist, and is causing- a great
          deal of discussion as to the prob
          able effect on the earth should it
          pass through the comet's tail.
          Flammarion is of the opinion
          that cyanogen gas would impreg
          nate the atmosphere and possibly
          snuff out all life'on the planet.
          Most astronomers do not agree
          with Flammarion, inasmuch as
          the tail of the comet is of almost
          inconceivable rarification, and
          believe it would be repelled by
          the mass of earth.

          When Earth Passes Through Tail of
          Halley's Comet?
          Mlany questions have been asked
          regarding the great comet that Is ex
          pected to be nearest the earth on
          May 17, and the following questions
          and answers were among those asked
          and answered by Rev. Fr. Hllllg of
          Toledo, and published in the Blade:
          When will we be nearest to the
          comet?
          On May 18, about 8 p. m., standard.
          The head of the comet will then be
          about 12.000,000 miles away from us,
          that Is about half the distance of
          Venus from the earth when the two
          are at their nearest approach. There
          will be a transit or tho comet across
          the sun's disc, because sun, comet
          and earth will then be in a straight
          line. The comet's tall will then
          brush over the earth's face provided
          the tall be over 12,000,000 miles long
          and half a million miles across at
          die earth's distance.
          What will happen when we collide
          with the comet's tall?
          Nothing In particular! There Is
          as little danger in that collision as
          there Is In colliding with the odorl
          ferlous particles emanating from the
          highly perfumed dress of a person
          that has crossed the sidewalk a few
          seconds before you arrive on that
          spot. The matter of the comet's tall
          is thinner than, .the residue of air
          contained In a globe after exhausting
          it witb. the most efficient air pump.
          Even if tho cometary matter were
          the most poisonous gas some of It
          13 highly poisonous cyanogen It
          could not hurt us, firstly, because It
          could hardly descend through our
          dense atmospheric envelope of 80
          and more miles thickness, and, sec
          ondly, because it would be diluted in
          the air so as to become absolutely
          Harmless.
          Will the fact that we pass through
          the tall be noticed at all?
          Perhaps and perhaps not. The
          earth has passed through a comet's
          tall on one or two former occasions
          without any sensible effect. The
          most that we may anticipate Is a pe
          culiar luminosity of .the sky on the
          evening of May 18, or perhaps a me
          teoric shower. However, this predic
          tion has less than half the probabil
          ity with which the weather-man an
          nounces his probable showers.

          in the comet in Salt Luke and there
          has been serious discussion of the re

          nent astronomers that the earth will be
          Iu danger on May 18 when it passes
          through the tail of the comet
          On that date the comet will be only
          10000000 miles away from the earth
          reaching Its closest proximity to this
          planet Professor Frost of the Yerkes
          observatory has found through ex
          periments that the comet shows pre
          dominant elements of sunlight in the
          spectroscope This he says shows the
          absence of the dangerous gases that
          were present when the experimnts
          were made last Januaryand this leads
          him to believe there Is no danger to

          for a brilliant display when it reaches
          the western sky at night are good
          They point out that at the time of its
          appearance in 1835 there were portions
          of its orbit which showed no tail

          Strange theories and strange fears
          concerning the comet have been ad

          Comets always have been regarded
          as harbingers of misfortune The ap

          of 1528 Is described by one writer as
          so horrible and so terrifying that It
          aroused such great terror among the
          common people that some of them died
          of fright while others fell sick
          The coming of Halleys comet In 1066
          was considered as prophetic of the Nor

          queen of William the Conqueror em

          representation of the terror caused by
          It
          Presaged an Invasion
          The comet of September 1301 was
          said to have presaged the Invasion of
          Italy by Charl of Valois The panic
          In Paris In 1773 was caused by tha
          failure of the astronomer Lalande to
          read his paper before the Academy of
          Sciences The rumor spread that he
          prophesied that the comet then ap
          proaching the earth would collide with
          I Not till the police forced Lalande
          Into publication of his manuscript
          proving that I contained no such refer
          ence did the fear become allayed
          Cabanes the historian of Napoleon
          declares that the banished emperor was
          quite serious In his prediction that the
          comet of 1816 was an omen of his own
          death
          The approach of Bielas comet In
          1832 caused great terror In Europe and
          America Damolseau had calculated
          that on October 29 the comet would
          cross the earths orbit at 0 distance
          within the orbit equal to four and two
          thirds the radius of the earth but the
          comets diameter was equal to five and
          a third radii of the earth This meant
          that two bodies would try to occupy
          the same space at the same time and
          that one or the other would be dis
          placed
          The widespread scare caused by this
          statement was not allayed until tho
          astronomer Arago proved that the
          earth would be at that time more than
          60000000 miles away from the point
          In Its orbit that the comet would then
          occupy
          Halleys comet of 1835 produced sev
          eral panics as did the comet of 1SS1
          As late as 1893 persons In the vicinity
          of Oakland Cal were stirred by a
          sect which declared that a comet fore
          told the end of the world One man
          Insisted on remaining near the Lick
          observatory declaring It would be the

          stead of the gaseous elements that ap
          peared in the January observations has
          led to wide speculation on the composi
          tion of comets
          Many distinguished astronomers have
          been wrestling with the problem of the
          elements of Halleys comet The presence
          of a bright yellow line In a continuous
          spectrum led Sir Robert Ball and Pro
          fessor Newall to believe that sodium or
          helium were present Professor Frost
          was the first to discover that In Janu
          ary before the comets passage back of
          the sun cyanogen was the principal ele
          ment In Us tall carbon nitrogen and
          hydrogen being also present Tabbutta
          comet of 1881 gave a spectrum of reflect
          ed sunlight in addition to the regular I
          gaseous specimens derived from Its tail
          Since it was the presence of cyanogeu
          gas In the comets spectrum that gave
          certain European astronomers of sensa
          tional tendency a basis for the prophecy
          that the earth would be destroyed in
          passing through the tall Professor
          Frosts discovery Is held reassuring
          The view Is generally accepted among
          scientists that the head of a comet con
          sists of a swarm of meteorites which
          may vary In size from fine dust to bodies
          several miles In diameter They consist
          largely of Iron with a small percentage
          of nickel
          Kant advanced the theory that comets
          were formed by cpndenslng solid nebula
          He considered them planets forced out of
          their normal orbits
          Laplace believed comets had a different I
          origin He held that they came from In I
          terstellar space and were composed of
          nebulous matter which was left free after
          the shrinking of the central nebula in its
          process of cooling and condensation He
          thought comets passed irom one solar
          system to another
          Schiaparelll was the first astronomer to
          suggest that there was a community of
          origin between comets and meteors Ac
          cording to him comets and meteors may
          be ejections from other suns Our own
          sun has frequently expelled matter at a
          velocity of 3SO miles a second and giant
          planets would behaye In similar fashion
          Theory is Confirmed
          Schlaparellis theory ha been confirmed
          by the fact that the spectroscope has
          shown that all selfluminous bodies in
          space are composed of meteorites
          The changes observed In Halleys comet
          probably are due to the disintegrating In
          fluence of the sun which may be reduc
          ing the head to meteoric dust mis head
          Is composed of a multitude of small In
          dependent solid bodies bathed In evolved
          gases and glowing with heat due to ar
          rested motion Most comets shine alto
          gether from an electric illumination of
          the gaseous constituents of their own at
          mosphere and for this reason the spec
          troscopic revelation that reflected sun
          light Is now the predominant element In
          the head of Halleys comet Is of decided
          Importance In the scientific world
          Prof Gibson of the University of Utah
          said yesterday I do not think that as
          yet the comet has been seen with the
          naked eye by anyone In Salt Lake lido
          think however that It has been seen or
          could have been seen with the aid of a
          telescope According to the calculations
          made six months ago the comet should
          have come Into view to the naked eye In I
          Salt Lake about April 1 Tho comet
          Sal Lke
          passed the sun about the last of March
          and began to move away from the sun
          At this time It should have become visible
          tme
          although it would not have appeared very
          bright on account of It being In the di
          rect light of the sun Sunday morning I
          surveyed the entire field with a telescope
          from 2 oclock In the morning until day
          light but I was unable to locate the
          comet I do think however that another
          attempt would prove successful as the
          field Is now well surveyed
          The comet will again return on us path
          toward tha sun on about May and Its
          maximum brightness will b about May
          18 At that time It may be seen In the
          early morning but I will be somewhat
          difficult on account of It again being in
          the direct light of the sun After May
          18 it will again move awn from the sun
          I will appear In the evening I think
          w1
          this will be the best time for I to be seen
          although at that time there will be an
          other difficulty In that the moon will be
          full and the comet will again b somewhat
          obscured by the bright light The fact
          that the comet will be at Its brightness
          cmet w1
          on May 18 does not mean that It will then
          be the largest that it has been but that
          It will then b passing directly over the
          toward the sun on about May 1 and us
          the earliest known
          the largest and one of earlest
          comets we have At times Its tall is fifty
          degrees long and Its Brightness is im

          SAW HALLEY'S COMET
          EL PASO WOMAN LOOKS SECOND TIME
          Having seen old man Halley's comet
          75 years ago, an El Paso woman is
          straining her aged eyes each night to
          see the comet of her girlhood again.
          Miss S. E. Church, who lives in East
          EI Paso and "who came here two years
          ago from her home in Ogdenburg, N.
          Y., says she has a vivid remembrance

          COMET CAN
          The comet has been seen by an El Pasoan. It was Halley's comet, too.
          Wednesday morning about 4 oclock, Henry E. Capell, vrho resides In Al
          tnra Park, while looking at the morning jtar, saw, a blot of light just a little
          to the north, of the tsr and trained his glasses upon it. At once, he could
          distinguish the tails of the comet and says It sbovred very plainly through his
          ipera glasses.
          The comet was Tlsible for Home time, but as day began to break, and the
          Kun began to put In an appearance, it disappeared, the sun's ray being too
          strong even for the most famous comet of the century. The comet appears
          almost directly above where the sun rices,
          Mr. Capell believes. 4 oclock i.s abont the best time to look Xor It.

          I don't remember whether it
          had a tail or not, but I do remember
          that it was so brilliant that it filled
          about one-third of the sky and covered
          our house with light. It looked real
          near to me then, and I am sure it was
          Halley's comet, for my folks had been
          taking down books to read about it for
          months before. That is whp I am anx-
          ious to see the comet this time. I have
          been redoing ab'out it for a 3ear and
          from what I have read, I believe it is
          the same one as the one I saw when a

          than the books describe it to ho now.

          HALLEYS COMET.
          Size.
          1,000,000 times larger than the
          earth.
          Speed.
          Millions upon millions of miles a
          day.
          Character.
          The comet is composed of three
          parts?nucleus, head an tail. The
          head is of the same composition as
          the tail, only denser. The head is
          so transparent that stars can be
          seen shining through it. Nothing
          is known of the composition of the
          nucleus.
          The Tail.
          It is composed of gas and minute
          particles of metal not unlike dust.
          Should the tail be long enough,
          when, on May 18th, the comet cuts
          through the plane of the earth, to
          reach the earth, the effect would be
          a fine display of luminous vapor.
          Time or Passage.
          Between 7:30 and 8:30 on the
          evening of May 18th the comet will
          pass between the earth and the
          sun. As the sun sets in Virginia
          on that date at 7:15, the World
          Almanac says it cannot be witness?
          ed in this state, but might be seen
          from California, Hawaii, Philip?
          pines and Japan, although it may
          be possible that at that time it will
          not be able to be seen even with
          the telescope.
          Distance.
          At the time the comet passes
          through the plane of the earth it
          will be 78,360,000 miles from the
          sun, 14,640,000 miles from the
          earth, and the tail, which always
          streams away from the sun, would
          have to be more than 14,640,000
          miles long to envelop the earth,
          and it may not be that long. The
          comet reaches its nearest point to
          the sun about the middle of April.
          Collision Impossible.
          While the orbits of the earth and
          the comet cross each other, they
          are not in the same plane. In oth?
          er words, it is no ''grade crossing."
          Thus, no collision of the earth and
          comet is possible.
          The Best Views.
          The best views of the comet for
          the general public will be from the
          middle of May, when it will be seen
          with the naked eye just before
          dawn a little south of where the
          sun rises and a little distance above
          the horizon; and again for a couple
          of weeks after May 18, when it will
          appear just after sunset, a little
          south of west and at a considerable
          height above the horizon.
          Finest Spectacle-The most in?
          teresting spectacle is expected to
          be afforded on May 1, when the
          comet nears Venus. The planet
          and the comet will be the same dis?
          tance from the earth and every one
          will be able to note their relative
          sizes. To see the comet then, one
          will have to be up before five
          o'clock in the morning. In fact,
          only the early risers will see the
          comet before it passes between the
          earth and the sun.
          Once Nearer.- In* 1835 Halley's
          comet came within 5,000,000 of the
          earth. As it did not then pass be?
          tween the earth and sun, the tail
          was pointed in another direction.
          The tail always paints away from
          the sun.
          No. Danger.? Eminent astrono?
          mers say there is no danger. It is
          not known for cerlain, when the
          comet passes between the earth and
          sun, whether or not the tail will be
          long enough to reach and envelop
          the earth. A California chemist
          claims to have discovered cyanogen
          gas (a deadly poison) in the tail.
          Prof. Fiost, of the Yerkes observa?
          tory, says: "The density of the
          comet is about the density of the
          vacuum in an electric bulb, and
          there cannot possibly be enough
          poisonous gas in it to hurt a fly."

          Halley’s Comet.
          Halley’s comet is now visible to (hel
          naket eye in the southwestern heavens
          just after dark. It can be seen from
          Central avenue and je just south of the
          north hill and sets about 7 o'clock.
          The planet Venus, which now sets
          about 8 o'clock, is 80 brilliant that the
          cowet is only dimly seen.
          Some persons bave douts as to this
          being Halley’s because of the report of
          A new comet that was discoved last
          mounth. These doubts will be strength
          ened by the disappearing of the Halley
          comet and its reappearing later. The
          new comet, however, is a rather faint
          telescopic comet which was descovered
          by Mr. Daniel at Princeton on the night
          of Decewber 6, 1909. .It wasthen about
          fifty inilion miles from us and is now
          peceding from earth and suv, but will
          yemain visible through the large tele-
          seope until the first of February or later.
          "On Beptember 12, 1908, Prof. Wolff,
          of Heidelberg, Germany, anuounced
          that he had seen Halley’s comet in the
          telescope. On September 15th, it was
          seen in the great telescopes of Lick and
          Yerkes observatories.
          The following calculations of the
          movements of the Halley comet from
          January 10th to May 26th, were made
          by Frank E. Seagrave of Providence,
          Rbode Island. and are’ copled frons
          Word and Works:
          “Japuary 10th it was in the south
          eastern part of constellation Pisces, not
          far from the planet Saturn, in the
          ecliptic; January 18th, 26th, February
          Brd, 11th, 19th, in the southern part of
          constellation Pisces. The comet will
          ‘naw grow bLrighter all the time. On
          February 27th it will be nine degrees
          south of the star Gamma Pegasi, and
          froms March 7th to April lst it will be
          lost in the sun’s rays. On April Bth
          the comet will rise in Pi» s abou’ an
          hour and 25 minutes before the sun.
          From April Bth to April 24th it will re.
          main nearly stationary in right ascen
          sion of constellation Pisces, rising an
          hour or two before the sun. On May
          20d it will still be in Pisces rising 2
          bours and 15 minutes before the sun.
          Eight days later, on May 10th, the
          comet will be in Aries moving very
          rapidly eastward this side of the sun.
          From May 10th to May 18th, its geocen
          tric motion will be extremely rapid,
          and the comet will move from Aries
          through Cetus, Orion and Monoceros
          to the east, reaching Hydra by May
          18th. On May 26th it will be In the
          constellation Bextuns, about 13 degrees
          south of Regulus.”
          This comet was discovered in 1682
          by Edmund Halley, an Englishman.
          Halley's demionstration that this comet
          was the same as the comet of 1458, 15631,
          and 1607 tirst fixed the identy of com
          ets. It performs its revolution in about
          75 years. Its previous appearance was

          Concerning the Fears of

          Col-
          New York, Oct. 26. Halley's comet Is
          now so near the earth that it may be
          observed in a short time through an
          ordinary telescope, according to reports
          received from different astronomical
          observatories.
          Although it has been speeding toward
          the earth with a tremendous velocity
          ever since it was re-discovered on the
          night of September 11, it is still far too
          remote to be seen with the naked eye.
          Harvard college observatory has Is
          sued a bulletin stating that Prof. E. E.
          Barnard of the Yerkes observatory ob
          tained visual observations of it on the
          17th and 19th of this month. -On these
          two dates Prof. Barnard found that thi
          comet was not fainter that the 13i
          magnitude, having a diameter of 15
          seconds and while it exhibited no
          elongation it was "less definite and
          brightening in the middle."
          Attracting World Wide Attention.
          The approach of Halley's comet is
          attracting the attention not only of as
          tronomers but of the laymen. There
          are many "ifs" in astronomy and from
          the diagram it is easy to see that if
          the earth should be in the position
          marked No. 1 in March instead of O'c
          tober, serious consequences might oc
          cur, and If during the month of June
          the earth crossed the path of the Hal
          ley comet instead of during the month
          of April, direful things might happen.
          But as a matter of fact, the governing
          law which planned the circuits' of the
          skies allowed for just these six months'
          difference in one case and two months
          difference in another so there Can be no
          danger whatever of a collision between
          the Halley comet and the earth.
          Coming at Rate 2,000,000 Miles a Day.
          This comet is approaching the earth
          at about the rate of 2,000,000 miles a
          day. It is now only, about 300,000,000
          miles away. Its nearest approach to
          the earth will be next May, when it
          will be about 10,000,000 miles away. The
          comet will then be visible to the naked
          eye for a short time.
          The Halley comet schedule is so
          arranged that jt appears only once to
          each generation-ofi mankind. It was
          here in 1835 and since then is esti
          mated to have traveled 6,800,000,000
          miles. It win be nearest the solar
          globe on the thirteenth of next April.
          The greatest brightness is expected to
          occur after the perihelion passage,
          when it will draw nearer the earth.
          On May 18 the comet will be only
          12,000.000 miles from the earth.
          Traced Back to 240 B. C.
          The returns of Halley's comet have
          recently been traced back to the year

          240 B. C, but it has probably been
          revolving in its elliptical orbit very
          much longer than that.
          Halley's discovery, after its appear
          ance in 1682, that it was a regular
          visitor to the neighborhood of the
          sun has always ranked as one of the
          capital triumphs of astronomy His
          suspicion that the comet of 16S2 was
          not paying its first visit to the sun
          was based upon the similarity between
          its orbit in space and the orbits of two
          other comets, which had appeared in
          1607 and 1531, respectively. He did
          not guess Its identity with the comets
          of 1456 and 1066. If the three were
          identical, then the same comet ought
          to return again after another interval
          of about seventy-six years. Accord
          ingly, Halley ventured the prediction
          that the comet would be back again in
          1753.
          Died Before His Prediction Fulfilled.
          Edmund Halley died in 1742 before
          his prediction had been fulfilled, but
          astronomers of the day followed his
          prophecy and watched for the comet
          in 1758, and sure enough It appeared.
          Because Halley determined its period
          icity astronomers have named the
          comet which appears once in every
          seventy-five years the Halley comet.

          as Halley’s comet, after the man "who
          first recognized that the comet was on
          its rounds, that ii had been here before
          and would be back again. Once in about
          75 years-generally longer—it completes
          its circuit of 6.869,000,000 miles. The
          schedule time varies somewhat on each
          trip on account of the different rel
          ative location of the planets and the
          consequent difference in their power of at
          traction. in. accordance with the law of
          gravitation. From the appearance of
          Halley's comet in 1758 until its appear

          while the lime i-, its m-M app.err.ineo

          The visits—often very far from welcome
          of Halley’s comet have numbered 25
          since its first recorded appearance in the
          year 11 B. C„ though doubtless it start
          ed its peregrinations before that time.
          A comet, especially such a ttomendous
          one as Halley's, used to be a pretty scary
          sort of thing. The quaint old picture,
          reproduced here from a bit of Bayeux
          tapestry, shows how the comet frightened
          our ancient forefathers upd how they told
          King Harold that, it looked as if it was
          all up with the old regime. This was in
          -1066. and soon after the appearance of
          the fearful omen the battle of Hastings
          was fought and William the Norman had
          won his surname of Conqueror. The
          comet was noted as particularly magnifi
          cent in 1145 and again in 1223, the year
          that Philip Augustus of France died. In
          1456 it was a. little late in its forecast
          of.dire calamity, for it came just after the
          capture of Constantinople by the Turks.
          In 1531 and 1607 careful note was taken
          of the course of the brilliant comet, sup
          posed then to be two Afferent ones and
          not related to any that had been seen
          before. Halley computed the orbit of the
          comet when it appeared in 1682 and by
          comparison of his data with that of the
          earlier visitors proved that the three were
          identical. He predicted that it would re
          turn at the end of 1758 or the beginning of
          1759. It was first seen on Christinas
          day in 1758 and reached its full glory the
          following spring.

          planetary motion, A spot appearing in the
          disk of the snn in July and August. 1676,
          uas observed by Halley, still only 18,
          with the result of his establishing the
          certainty of the motion of the sun around
          its own axis. He made extended mid
          important discoveries regarding the varia
          tion of the comnaks, traversing both hemi
          spheres for the purpose nnd living in a
          tent on St Helena nt a spot still called
          Halley’s mount. In 1703 Halley was
          elected Sovilian professor of geometry at
          Oxford nnd in 1720 was appointed as
          tronomer-royal nt Greenweb. where he
          spent the rest of his life. In 1721 he be
          gan his observations of the motion of the
          iiinoti and for Ik years scarcely ever missed
          taking a meridian view of it when the
          weather was favorable. He made many
          charts, compiled many tables mid was
          the author of n great number of papers.
          He died tit Greenwich in 1742.
          Halley was only 20 or 26 years old
          when his observation of the comet which
          bears his name' resulted in one of the
          most interesting contributions of modem
          times to the science of astronomy—the
          establishing of the periodicity of those
          heavenly skyrockets. That one man
          should see and take scientific observa
          tions of Halley’s eomet on two dif
          ferent appearances, with a period
          of 75 years between, is outside the plan
          of Nature. The boy astronomer was an
          old man—be died at the age of 86—when
          he left with his successors the duty of
          clinching the proof of his discovery. He
          told them to remember, when the
          Comet put in an appearance, that it
          was an Englihsman who first predict
          ed that it Would do so. Halley died 17
          years before his prediction could be ful
          filled. Then the scene was shifted to
          France. Two great French mathemati
          cians—one of them a woman—and a
          young astronomer took up the work of
          completing the triumph of astronomical
          science.
          A Problem in Mathematics.
          Calculating the course of comets would
          stump the average prize pupil in mathe
          matics it’s a job for a master. The law
          of gravitation, as everybody knows, is that
          everything attracts everything else, accord
          ing to mass and distance. The comet can be
          reckoned as practically without mass, so
          the problem becomes one of the action on
          the comet of the planets, given their mass
          and distance. Their mass was not as well
          known in 1757 as it is now—and there is
          still much about it to be learned—and as
          for distance, the very existence of Uranus
          and Neptune had not been discovered. But
          there were sufficient data for a good hard
          job of figuring, which, with some allowance
          for the unknown, was pretty sure to bring
          ibe expected result, if Halley was all right
          in his theory. It was Alexis Claude Clairaut
          who undertook the tremendous, task- He
          devoted months to preliminary calculations
          to show how the disturbing influence of
          Jiipiter and Saturn could be estimated. At
          this stage of his work he had merely re
          duced the problem to problem form; there
          were months more of work before the prob
          lem could be solved. This task was intrust
          ed to Mme Lepante, a mathematical genius,
          with the assistance of Jerome de Lelande,
          a young astronomer. They plotted the com
          et’s course into space more than 2000 mill
          ion miles beyond the then known boundaries
          of the solar system, and for a period of
          .150 years of its journeyiugs. The woman
          and her young assistant worked day and
          night for six months, scarcely stopping to
          eat. The woman stood the ordeal the better
          of the two, but both hung on and reached
          their goal in the middle of November, 1758,
          just about a month before the comet was
          first seen again. That was on Christmas
          night and the lucky star gazer to first re
          port it was George l’alilsch, a farmer in
          Saxony.
          The diagram on this page indicates the
          course of the comet across the orbits of
          the planets. The small circle, which is not
          named, represents the orbit of the earth,
          and within that is indicated the sun, to
          which the comet is returning to pay its
          periodical tribute. It was at its aphelion, or
          point farthest from the sun. in 1874. It
          passed within the orbit of Neptune about
          1805, past the course of Uranus in 1903, of
          Saturn in 1908, and of Jupiter this year.
          While it is on a visit to the sun, it will
          come only within about 66-,000.000 miles of
          the sun—its perihelion—before turning back
          on its course. That will be about April 13
          next. About May 18 following it will be
          within 12,000,000 or 13,000,000 miles of
          the earth. near enough to lash its great tail
          over us, and perhaps destroy our me with
          carbonic acid gas' or set us on fire with
          acetylene, if it were not for the inexorable
          law which Newton discovered, and some
          other laws of astronomical physics which
          the savants are still puzzling their heads
          over.
          The Comet of ISS2.
          Thirteen million miles does not :eem so
          far when it is remembered that the great
          comet of J. 882, which many of us saw out
          of the southeast windows in the early morn-
          HALLEY'S COMET IN 1836.
          [After John Herschel.]
          ing, had a tail 200.000,000 miles long. To
          dwell on that brilliant memory a moment,
          it is interesting to know that the astrono
          mers have a theory that the comet of 18b2
          was really a piece of an earlier, comet,
          which had been split up, perhaps, by col
          lision with a still undiscovered planet, be
          yond the orbit of Neptune. This planet, if
          it exists, is located, according to Prof
          Forbes’s calculations, about MOO million
          miles from the sun-—that is, about a hun
          dred times the distance of the earth from
          the sun. It is also interesting that ths
          comet of 1882 approached within 300,000
          miles of the sun’s surface—only l-40tb the
          distance which will separate Halley’s comet
          next spring—with the result that it was
          split up into five separate comets, or at
          least “showed a tendency to fall apart.”
          This brilliant comet is due to return in
          about 750 or 1000 years, if it doesn't get
          reduced to a shower of meteors .-Before then.
          The ancient astronomers had nothing at
          all to say about comets. They began to
          bp talked about scientifically in the micldle
          of the Christian era but it was pretty gen
          erally believed that they were atmospheric
          phenomena and not astronomical bodies.
          George Busch, a German, varied the mo
          notony in 1572 by advancing the theory
          that comets were the accumulated sins
          of mortals being burned in the upper air
          whence was deposited upon the earth
          much badness in the form of gas and other
          deleterious matter. The doctors are not
          yet agreed exactly as to the nature of
          comets, so the lay render may easily be
          puzzled as to just what to believe. He
          will be pardonable if he accepts tenta
          tively some such proposition as this: The
          comets belong to the solar system, being
          part of the orginnl matter from which
          also the planets were formed. They visit
          the sun periodically, following an ellip
          tical orbit, scarcely to be distinguished,
          when they are within our view, from n
          parabolic orbit. Their mass, or density,
          is very slight but their volume immense.
          It has been said that the average density
          of gie average comet is about l-7000th
          tha“of the atmosphere of the earth, and
          that if nn average comet could be gath
          ered into a laboratory it could be con
          densed into a pill-box.
          A Sort of Moving Sandbank,
          One astronomer has described a comet
          as a sort of moving sandbank consisting
          of particles varying in ^ize from that of
          a pin head to pieces as big as a good-sized
          stone, but with many hundred feet of
          space between the particles. They contain
          sodium, magnesium and iron, and various
          gases, and are luminous partly from their
          own light and partly by the reflected light
          of the sun. The cornel of 1882, including
          its tail, was Hi volume about 8009 times
          the size of the sun and about 10,000 mill
          ion times the size of the earth. Its bead
          could have taken in the earth and moon
          at the sumo time while its tail swept the
          sun. The force of gravitation causes the
          sun to draw the comet toward it, but at
          the same time some contrary force drives
          the particles away from the nucleus so
          that they stream out into spuee-iik<- hairs,
          lienee the name comet, from “coma. M
          W hat. this repelling force is has been vh?
          riousjy explained but the latest theory
          THE SPRINGFIELD WEEKLY REPUBLICAN; THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1909
          appears to be that it is the force of the
          light from the sun.
          Some 800 comets are on record of which
          about half were recorded before the di»-
          covery of the telescope in 1610. Of the
          400 discovered since that date only some
          70 or 80 have been visible to the naked
          eye. The most brilliant comet of the last
          century was the comet of 1882, Whether
          Halley’s comet will be still more of a
          spectacle next spring cannot certainly be
          foretold. Various astronomical elements
          enter into the speculation. It is said,
          for instance, that comets are very likely
          to lose some <>t their substance on their
          visits to tlie sun. so that, other things
          being equal, a comet on each return should
          be less brilliant than on its previous visit.
          But. whatever the ifs and huts, great
          expectations may safely be entertained for
          the spring visit in 1910 of the great no
          mad of the skies.

          THE APPEARANCE OF HALLEY’S COMET IN 1066.
          [From a Bayeux tapestry.]
          the. earth have passed into history and
          are ready for reduction. Probably our
          most valuable knowledge of Mars will
          come from these observations, and it must
          be remembered that Mars cannot again
          be observed at near view for the next
          15 years. Hence the importance of the
          near opposition just passed.
          Here let some mistakes concerning the
          distance of Mars from the earth nt the
          late opposition be corrected. At the op
          position, September 23, a dispatch was
          sent out from Washington saying that
          Mars was then 35,000,000 miles from
          the earth. Mars may come this near to
          the earth nt ..some opposition, but it did
          not come this near at the last one. In
          1892. 1 think ,it did come to within 35,-
          000,000 miles pf the earth. In 1997, its
          nearest approach was 38% million miles
          from the earth, but at the recent opposi
          tion, its nearest approach was 36,190,000
          miles, on September 18; and on September
          23. the date of the astronomical opposi
          tion, the distance was 36,340,000 iniles.
          Some newspapers got very wild in stat
          ing the distance of Mars at that time.
          One newspaper stated that Mars was
          coming less than 30,000,000 miles from
          the earth! The fact is that Mars can
          never come this near the earth. About
          34% millions is as near ns it can ever
          come, and 35,000,000 is the more usual
          distance at a near opposition.
          While Mars is going away from ns,
          Halley's comet is coming nearer to us.
          If the predictions are fulfilled, the ap
          pearance of the comet will be one of tbe
          great astronomical events of the century.
          But while we are thinking of the comet,
          let us form a correct idea about tbe size
          of its orbit. Ils greatest distance from
          the sun is 35.2238 times the distance of
          the earth from the sun; or 3,272,291,000
          iniles. Its nearest distance from the sun
          is .6871 times the distance of the earth
          from the sun, or 63,931,590 miles. This
          makes the major axis of the orbit 3.336,-
          222,590 miles, or nearly 36 times the dis
          tance of the earth from the sun. The
          minor axis of the orbit is 929.000.000 miles
          or 10 times the distance of tbe earth from
          the sun. Knowing the major and minor
          axes of the comet's orbit, the circumfer
          ence of the orbit may be computed. A
          calculation shows this circumference to
          be 7,393,000,000 miles. This is the cir
          cuit the comet travels in one revolution.
          If this seems immense, just pause while
          one learns the circumference of Neptune's
          orbit. This is 17,540,000,000 miles, about
          2% times the circumference of the orbit
          of Halley's comet!
          Now one of the interesting features of
          the comet is its speed. On account of the
          extreme distances it makes from the sun,
          this speed varies. The aphelion or great
          est distance from the sun, is 51.25 times
          its nearest or perihelion distance. Hence
          its speed at perihelion is 51.25 times its
          speed at aphelion. If we reduce the
          comet’s period of revolution (75% years)
          to days and divide this into 7.393,000,000,
          the circumference of the comet’s orbit, it
          comes out 268,000 miles a day. This is
          the average speed of the comet, and it is
          equal to one-half its greatest and least
          speed. Hence we have the sum of its
          greatest and least speed equal to 5311.000
          miles, and the greatest speed is 51.25
          times its least speed. This reduces the
          matter to a simple arithmetical problem.
          The result comes out 525.742 miles a day
          for its greatest speed, mid 10,258 miles a
          day for its least speed. Put in another
          way. it is seven miles n minutes for its
          least speed, and 365 miles a minute or
          little more than six miles a second for
          its greatest speed. Now remember that
          the earth's speed in its orbit is 18% miles
          a second. So the comet when nearest the
          sun travels only about one-third of the
          earth’s velocity in its orbit, go this “in
          erediblc speed" of which some writers
          have spoken in regard tq Halley’s comet,
          is not so incredible after nil.
          Another interesting phase of the comet
          is the comparative light and heat it re
          ceives st perihelion and aphelion. Sime
          the comet is 51.25 times as far away from
          the sun at aphelion as nt perihelion, it
          follows that the light and heat of the
          comet will vary inversely ns the square of
          51.25. Or its light and heat, at perihelion
          is little more than 2600 times its light and
          heat nt aphelion.
          When Halley’s comet becomes visible to
          the naked eye it is likely some will rcgnrd
          it with superstition. Charles V resigned
          bis crown on the evil portents suggested
          by the Ittipearancc of a comet, and Plu
          tarch. relates that n cornet apjieared at
          the time of Julins I'ae^tr's assassination.
          Also, recall this passage from Sbake
          speare's “Jiillhb .Caesar”;—
          ■Whew beggn-rs die. there are no comets seen
          The heavens themselves blaze Jforth the death
          of lumees,
          This is supposed- to he the sama comet
          that appeared in 1680. and was studied
          by Sir Isaac Newton just two years be
          fore Haller observed tbe comet that bears
          his name. The notable appearance of
          Halley's comet in 1456 hss been fre
          quently alluded to. The ringing of the
          Angelus in the Catholic church ritual
          dates from the appearance of Halley's
          eomet in 1450. Note this line from Long
          fellow’s ’‘Evangeline”:—
          Sweetly over the village the bell of the An
          gelus sounded.
          When Evangeline heard the Angelus ring
          she wasn’t thinking about Halley's comet,
          or any other comet. Gabriel was the star
          that shone brightest in l>#r soul.
          It is not likely that Halley's comet will
          strike the earth. However, our genial
          American poet, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
          just starting on his literary career in
          1835 (the year of the last appearance of
          Halley’s comet) dreamed that the comet
          struck the earth. The consternation that
          followed the collision is vividly described

          Since writing the above, the writer has
          noticed a dispatch from Cincinnati, 0.,
          dated November 5. stating that Halley’s
          comet had been seen at that place, and
          that it was moving toward the sun at the
          rate of 1,000.090 miles nn hour. This
          means 24,000,000 a day, or 2,160,000,000
          miles in 90 days. Now this is nearly one
          third of the circumference of the comet's
          orbit, and at this rate of travel the comet
          would pass its perihelion before March
          1. 1910. No astronomical authority I have
          seen places the perihelion passage earlier
          than May 12, and some eminent astron
          omer's place it at May 24. The writer's
          results, given ab0ve—525,742 miles a day
          for perihelion and 10,258 miles a day for
          aphelion, are his own deductions. If his
          calculation and results are wrong, he
          would like to know wherein they are
          wrong. o. E. H

          WHERE IS COMET?
          IS GETTING TOO CLOSE TO THE
          SUN TO BE SEEN IN THE
          EVENING SKY
          WILL BE VISIBLE IN APRIL
          Reaches Nearest Approach to the Sun
          April 20th, and Will Appear in
          Morning Sky a Few
          Days Later
          (By Eugene Stough.)
          "Comets are scattered through
          the heavens with as much
          profusion as tishese In the
          ocean.”
          ASPECTS AND DATES.
          Probably not visible but a few
          days; too close to sun, and ex
          actly behind it March 24.
          Nearest approach to sun April
          20, comet will appear in morn
          ing sky a few days later. Comet
          and Earth will rapidly ap
          proach each other until middle
          of May.
          Comet will pass between earth
          and sun May 18th, and a few
          days later will appear in even
          ing sky. Will gradually vanish
          from unaided vision, but will be
          seen telescopically until late in
          year.
          Edmund Halley was probably one
          and sagacious
          astronomers that ever lived. At New
          ton's request he made a thorough in-
          the most industrious
          vestigation of the movements and the
          laws governing the comet of 1682, and
          boldly declared its identity with those
          of 1456, 1531 and 1607. He predicted
          It would return in the year 1758, and
          true to its period, it did return, and
          was "picked up” by an amateur as
          tronomer on Christmas day, of that
          year. And this is why it came to be
          known as Halley’s comet.
          OrLit of Halley'* Comet.
          When this comet appeared In 1456
          the belief was general, among all the
          classes, that it would destroy the
          world. Much has been said and writ
          ten about Pope Calllxtus 111, with ref
          erence to that visitation. Platina,
          who was archivist at the Vatican, says
          that the astronomers and mathematic
          ians had predicted pestilence and dire
          calamities and the Pope ordered sup
          plications to avert these and to divert
          them to the Turks, who at that time
          threatened to overwhelm Christen
          dom. The ringing of bells was ord
          ered not to affright the comet but to
          remind the faithful to pray in behalf
          of those who were in mortal combat
          with the Turks.
          There is nothing particularly extra
          ordinary about their forebodings of
          disaster. Nearly four hundred years
          later, in 1835, the French government
          called upon her ablest astronomers
          and mathematicians to determine, on
          mathematical principles, how many
          chances of collision there would be
          between the earth and comet at the
          return that year, and they reported
          there was just one chance in 281,000,-
          000. Ami now, today, the scientists
          of the world profoundly learned ’n
          physics and astrophysics are speculat
          ing on what the consequences will b
          If the earth shall pass through the
          tall of this self-same comet on that
          critical day of May 18th. when it will
          pass between earth and sun.
          A little three-sided bar of glass—
          the spectroscope —has told them that
          the comets tail contains cyanogen: a
          deadly poison when mingled with
          certain elements of our atmosphere,
          and this wonderful little piece of glass
          has also told them there is kinship
          between -fhe meteorite and the comet.

          carbon crystalized there. It is a sig
          nificant fact that a vaporized aerolite
          gives the same spectrum as cometic
          materials. Schiaparelli, noted Italian
          astronomer, believes that aerolites
          are disbursed cometic matter; disin
          tegrated comets.
          Biela’s comet in 1846, split in tw’o,
          from proximity to earth, and tJie twin
          comets swept through space 16,000
          miles apart until they disappeared.
          This comet had a period of seven
          years. It failed to appear the three
          following periods. On November 27,
          1872, there was an extraordinary
          meteoric shower throughout Europe.
          A Berlin astronomer noted the point
          of radiation which was low and vanish
          ing. He conjectured there was con
          nection between the meteors and Bie
          la’s comet, it being the year of its
          period, and telegraphed an astronom
          ic friend at Madras: "Biela touched
          earth November 27. Search for him
          near Theta Centauri.” The Madras
          astronomer found the comet in the
          star group named and easily identified
          it —but it was tailless.
          Herschell says that Lexell’s comet,
          with a period of five years, got tangl
          ed in the moons of Jupiter and was
          never afterwards seen. Astronomers
          today believe that Jupiter’s eighth
          moon is the lost Lexell comet.
          Tennyson wrote of moonless Mars,
          but in 1877 Prof. Asaph Hall of Wash
          ington, through a 26-inch telescope
          discovered the planet had two; they
          are mere toy moons, one ten and the
          other about fifteen miles in diameter.
          Then there is Saturn witn her nine
          moons and her double girth of gold;
          the most magnificent spectacle in
          stardom. Has she, too, been catch
          ing comets? The rings of Saturn are
          believed to be myriads of minute
          satellites.
          Positions of Comet, Earth and Sun.
          Halley’s comet has been traced back
          definitely to the year 12, B. C. Chinese
          astronomers recorded that visitation
          and subsequent ones. Some authori
          ties trace it back to 500 years B. C.
          On its return this year it was dis
          covered almost exactly in the region
          of space where eminent mathematic
          ians had computed its position. At
          that time it was over 300,000,000 mMes
          from the sun. That was in Septem
          ber. At midnight on December 1, It
          was on the meridian, a few degrees
          south of exactly overhead. It ap
          proached the earth to within 125,000,-
          000 miles, but comet and earth are
          separating now owing to contrary
          orbital motions. It is rapidly ap
          proching the sun and March 24th will
          be exactly on opposite side of the sun
          from the earth, as you will note in
          the diagram showing positions and
          dates April 20th h will swing out
          in the morning sky, then appearant
          ly back toward the sun, but in reality
          swinging in to pass between sun and
          earth, about May 18th. It will be in
          visible for a short time before and
          after this event, and then will appear
          in the evening sky, and slowly vanish
          ing will return again to the point of
          its appelion, several hundred millions
          of miles beyond the orbit of Neptune,
          whence our sun would be a glow
          worm light in a cosmic mgnt.
          A little westward of directly over
          head about eight o’clock in the even
          ing, if you care to look, you will no
          tice a little cluster of stars; the
          Pleiades. Only a few degrees? west 's
          the ruddy star, Mars, and about half
          w-ay down the sky is a star of yellow
          ish hue, Saturn, these mark almost
          exactly the comets path in January.
          High in the northeast is the Big
          Dipper. Everybody knows some
          thing about the Dipper. Notice
          the star at the bend in the handle--
          Mizar, and notice nestling closely to
          it a companion of much lesser light;
          Alcor. You may have to look sharply
          to see it. for the ancient Arabians ac
          counted It a test of eyesight to dis
          cover it. Richard A. Proctor says
          that the distance separating those
          stars is so great that the orbit of the
          irreat comet of 1811 would only span
          one-fourth of it. The comet of 1811
          had an orbit six times as great as
          Halley’s comet. This means that you
          could place twenty-four Halley comet
          orbits end to end and have a chain
          barely long enough to connect these
          two stars. The orbit of Halley’s
          comet is between thirty-five and forty
          thousand millions of miles.
          Divide a mile into inches; the inch
          would represent the distance of the
          earth from the sun. and the mile, the
          distance it would take the sun’s light
          to travel in a year: a light year; as It
          is termed technically. And yet, there
          are stars so remote, it is affirmed,
          their light would not reach us in a
          thousand years.
          Wonderful, is it not? But listen to
          this from an -astronomer who stands
          among the first in this country today.
          Prof. Edgar Larkin of Mount Lowe
          observatory. says. that the thousands
          of stars we see’ by natural vision may
          be cast aside as negligible in comput
          ing the sun and world material In
          the Universe.
          Please don’t worry about what Is
          going to happen from this visitation
          of Halley’s comet. There is “directiv

          One of the most notable features of the
          scientific tendencies of the present day is
          the extraordinary interest taken in the in
          vestigation ofthosejeculiar physical and
          psychical conditions now known collec
          tively under the name of hypnotism
          varying from lethargy catalepsy etc to
          somnambulism Until quite recently
          these investigations have been frowned
          upon and taboed in scientific circles and
          the fact that any man of scientific inclina
          tions was known to feel an interest in
          matters associated with mesmerism or
          animal magnetism was sullicient to
          make him an object of suspicion and in
          jure his good standing among his fellow
          scientists The result of these socalled
          investigations instituted by the French
          academy pronouncing in effect the whole
          subject a humbug and delusion has lain
          like an interdict upon further re
          searches and the whole matter was left
          over for the most parr to charlatans or
          to persons hardly capable of forming
          sound judgment or proceeding according
          to the accurate methods demanded by
          modern science Science however in
          the remarkable progress made of late
          23 advanced so far upon certain lines
          vt It has been hardly possible to pro
          od further in those directions without
          leering upon the forbidden fied There
          re the old signboards against trespass
          is have bten taken down For
          mesmerism that verbal scarecrow has
          been substituted hypnotism which
          word has had a wonderfully legitimizing
          effect while animal magnetism that
          once llouted idea has been proven to be

          as those adopted by Faraday or
          Edison to verily their observations
          EFFORTS OK SCIENTISTS
          Many of the most eminent scientists of
          Europe are now devoting themselves
          assiduously to these researches Periodi
          cals making a specialty of the subject are
          now published in France Germany and
          England A catalogue of the recent
          literature of hypnotism and related phe
          nomena compiled by Max Dessoir was
          printed in the number of the German
          magazine called the Sphinx for February
          of this year and this catalogue occupied
          nine pages The list is limited to those
          words written on the lines laid under the
          methods of the modern school all books
          being excluded whose authors hold to
          mesmeric theories or who are even
          professional magnetizers The catalogue
          is therefore as strictly scientific as pos
          sible and being classified with German
          thoroughness under the different branches
          of the subject such as hysterohypnot
          ism suggestion fascination etc
          it will prove a valuable assistance to the

          In this country the interest of scient
          1s has not yet been aroused to an ex
          mt comparable to that of European in
          jstigators Old prejudices have not
          5tirely lost their potency One of the
          most eminent professors of s leading
          university is said to have been subjected
          to ridicule from his colleagues because of
          a marked interest shown in the subject
          and a Boston physician of high standing
          within a few months confided to the
          writer that he had made use of hypnotic
          methods with gratifying success in the
          case of a patient where ordinary reme
          dies hd proved unavailing but he did
          not venture to make the result public
          since his fellowdoctors might be inclined
          to condemn his action as irregular
          A work embracing the whole subject
          has lately appeared in Paris and as it is
          to form a volume of the valuable Inter

          English French German and Italian it

          been prosecuted according to the most
          exact scientific methods and with the

          possess the great scientific virtue of
          never dogmatizing In the entire book
          not a single law is laid down not a

          not reached by the most improved in

          the book lies in its enunciation of new
          and trustworthy methods for studying
          the physiology of the brain in health and
          disease while It brings into the realm of

          THE HYPNOTIC SLEEP
          is described as a different form of natu
          ral sleep and all the causes which bring
          on fatigue are capable of bringing on
          hypnotism on suitable subjects Two
          of the leading hypnotic states are lethar
          gy and catalepsy the former being anala
          gous to deep sleep and the latter to a
          light slumber In lethargy the respirato
          ry movements are slow and deep cat
          alepsy slight shallow very slow and
          separated by a long interval In lethargy
          the application of a magnet over the re
          gion of the stomach causes profound mod
          ifications in the breathing and circulation
          while there is eo such effect in catalepsy
          This shows the connection of hypnotism
          with magnetism and various other ex
          periments with magnets have produced
          some wonderful results Here it may be
          added that Dr Geesmam a Vienna
          scientist who has made a specialty of
          hypnotic 8titdies has Invented and suc
          cessfully applied an Instrument called a
          hypnoscope consisting of an arrangement
          of magnets for the purpose of ascertain
          ing whether any persons is a good hyp
          notic subject
          The experiments demonstrate that
          sensation In the hypnotic states varies
          Detween the two opposite poles of
          hypetcc3thesia and antesthesia in other
          words the senses may be extraordinarily
          excited as in somnambulism or as in
          lethargy they may be extinct except
          sometimes hearing In somnambulism
          the field of vision and acutebess of sight
          are about double hearing is made very
          acute and smell is so intensely develop
          ed that a subject can find by scent the
          fragments of a card previously given to
          him to feeJ and torn up and hidden The
          memory of somnambulism is similarly
          exalted When awakened the subject
          does not as a rule remember anything
          that occurred when he was entranced
          but when again hypnotized his memory
          includes all the facts of his sleep his life
          when awake and his former sleeps
          ltichet attests how somnambules recall
          with a luxury of detail scenes in which
          they have taken part and places they
          have visited long ago M one of
          his somiambules sings the air of the
          second act of the opera LAfricaine when
          she is asleep but cnnot remember a
          note of it when awake
          There is a theory that no experience
          wlmtever of a person is lost to the mem
          ory it is only the power to recall it that
          is defective The authors of this work say
          that while the exaltation of the memory
          during somnambulism does not give ab
          solute proof to the theory that nothing is
          lost it proves at any rate that the mem
          ory of preservation is much greater than
          is generally imagined in comparison with I tauce of
          ing recollection more
          or less vivid per
          sists for a lew seconds then becomes ef
          faced This forgetfulness is even more
          marked in the case of hypnosis On re
          turning to natural consciousness the sub
          ject cannot recompose o single one of the
          scenes in which he has played his part as
          a witness or actor The loss howeveri3
          not complete for often a word or two is
          sufficient to bring back a whole scene
          though this word or two coming from
          operator to subject partakes more or less
          of the nature ot a suzgestion
          SUGGESTION
          Suggestion by which is meant the
          production of thoughts and actions on the
          part of the subject through some indica
          tion or bint given by the operator is
          found to be analagous to dreaming Say
          the authors All suggestion consists
          essentially in acting on a person by an
          idea every effect suggested is the re
          sultant of a phenomenon of ideation but
          we must add that the idea is but an
          outward sign taken alone it is only in
          dicative of some physiological process
          which Is alone capable of producing a
          material effect Persons vary in their
          susceptibility to suggestion For sug
          gesiion to succeed the subject must have
          naturally fallen or been artifically
          thrown into the state of morbid re
          ceptivity but it is difficult to deter
          mine accurately the conditions of susges
          tionability However we may mention
          two The first is the mental inertia or
          the subject the consciousness
          is completely empty an idea is suggest
          ed and reigns supreme over the slumber
          ing consciousness The second
          is psychic hyperexcitability the cause of
          the aptitude for suggestion From the
          standpoint of psychology the explanation
          of the effects of suggestion is to be found
          in the association of ideas Suggestion
          in its positive aspect is nothing eise than
          the throwing Into action of a mental as
          sociation preexisting in the spirit
          of the hypnotic For example we
          say to a patient Look you have a
          bird in your apron and no sooner arc
          these simple words pronounced than she
          sees the bird feels it with herfingersand
          sometimes even hears it sing All these
          ideas are associated in the mind by habit
          and consequently they are called into
          action Again in place of speech we
          engage the attention of the patient and
          when her gaze has become settled and
          obediently follows all our movements we
          imitate with the hand the motion of an
          object which dies Soon the patient
          cries Oh what a pretty bird How
          has a simple gesture produced so singu
          lar an effect Again by the association
          of ideas But this case differs from the
          preceding in being only an association of
          resemblance
          It is admitted however that Ihe hy
          pothesis ol the association of ideas only
          partly covers the facts of suggestion even
          when stretched to include resemblances
          For instance When we charge the brain
          of an entranced patient with some strange
          idea such as On awakening you will
          rob Mr Soandso of his handkerchief
          and on awakening the patient accom
          plishes the thet commanded there is
          nothing more than an image associated
          with an act In point of fact the patient
          has appropriated and assimilated the idea
          of the experimenter She does not pas
          sively execute a strange order but the
          order has passed in her consciousness
          from passive to active We can go as
          far as to say that the patient has the will
          to steal This state is complex and ob
          scure hitherto no one has explained ifc

          lncn may bo hypnotized, but it is very
          difllcult to produco hypnotic slccp in old

          Study of the Hypnotic State.
          Dr. A. Dichas has mado n detailed study
          of tho memory In tho hypnotic state, nnd
          summarizes his main conclusions
          as follows: (1) during tlio hypnotic
          sleep tho subject remembers the experiences
          of his wiking Ufo ns well rs of
          previous hypnosis; (2) in hypnotism tlicro
          is often an exalt tion of tho memory, and
          at times n cliang in Its content, leading
          to tho assumpti n of a foreign
          (3) tho mo nory of what has been
          going on during hypnosis is usually lost,
          it can often bo ruvlvcd by n simplo suggestion,
          and at times the memory of a
          suggested hallucination may l!.,jor on.
          and influenco thu waking condition; (4)
          tho operator cau at his wjll havo any of
          tho nets of the liypnotK state remembered
          or forgotten by maMug this a part
          of tho suggestion; (5) sitgjfcstion seems to
          bo largely explicable 'as unconscious
          memory.
          Dr. Cybulski has studied tho power of
          hypnotic subjects to hypnotlzo themselves.
          IIo finds that such subjects
          strongly Imagiuo for a mlnuto or less that
          that tho operator commands them to go
          to sleep, nnd tho desired result ensues.
          Furthermore, If tlio subject, on going to
          sleep, imagines himself controlled by a
          certain person, then, even though another
          sent him to sleep, he will bo subject to
          tlio former, nnd not to tho operator.
          These observations show the Importance
          of tho subjectivo clement in tho process
          of hypnotism, nnd Indicate tho method by
          which tho subject unconsciously takes
          suggestions and acts upon them. Dr.
          Bcrkhan has applied hypnotism to the
          amelioration of the hearing of tho deaf.
          Ho tested tho hearing of nino deaf boys,
          and, after hypnotizing them, spoko to
          them and had varions.noises made before
          them Tho hearing of four of them was
          found to bo Improved, and tho improve
          merit is reported as still persisting after
          eighteen months Science.

          THE ABUSE OF HYPNOTISM.
          Quack* and CliarlntaiM Wlio Mukti I'M OL
          It to iiull the Public.
          Wliilo tho benefits from hypnotism
          thus fur have been few anil small, the
          evils have been many nml great. Its
          Bleeplike btato is not a normal sleep,
          bringing health and Htrength to the
          sliuuberer, but a morbid conditiou bor­
          dering u|iou disease. It irritates the en­
          tire nervous organization and tempora­
          rily if not organically weakens the sys­
          tem. This drawback is serious enough.
          Darker and more terrible effects lie in
          the suppression of the object's will for
          the time being, and the substitution
          therefor of the operator's. In this re­
          gard it opens avenues to crime and crimi­
          nals such us has never been equaled
          heretofore. Already so many discredit­
          able actions, not to use a stronger word,
          have been committed in Europe by
          means of hypnotism that in Italy, Aus
          tro-Hungary, parts of Switzerland, Co­
          penhagen and other municipalities laws
          have been enacted prohibiting its public
          practice by any except physicians. So,
          on the other hand, tip police, without
          any statute on the subject, have treated
          traveling mesmerists as disorderly char­
          acters. Thus Donato was expelled from
          Italy, and Hansen, another hypnotist,
          from Austria, was notified never to re­
          turn under penalty of arrest, fine and
          imprisonment.
          This Donato (whose real name, by the
          way, is Dhont) hypnotized an Italian ar­
          tillery officer, who immediately became
          half crazy. From time to time he would
          go into somnambulism at the sight of a
          bright object. He would follow carriage
          iamps. and unless prevented would walk
          toward locomotive or steamer lights.
          An architectural student was mesmer­
          ized by staring at his compasses, after
          which it was impossible for him to draw
          without going to sleep.
          A young girl of Milan, of beauty and
          character, was hypnotized and impressed
          with the notion that she was married 'o
          a man she had never seen but once, and
          then in the darkness. She went crazy
          and died in a hospital.
          Another voting girl (of Paris, this
          time) was put under a similar spell and
          was ruined. She finally entered the
          Saltpetriere hospital, where, after along
          and painful remedy, what was left of
          her former self was pronounced cured.
          In New York a hypnotized person was
          made to believe that he had taken slow
          poison. He fell sick and wasted away
          to a shadow. Not until the attending
          physician discovered the true nature of
          the hallucination and relivpnotized the
          subject was there any symptom of con­
          valescence.
          In Turin, at a series of hypnotic lec­
          tures and public experiments, a large
          proportion of those who attended were
          taken sick with headache, insomnia and
          other nervous ailments. A few of those
          who were of a hysterical temperament
          remained ill for along time.
          In the foregoing cases the hypnotizing
          was done with no evil intent, but there
          are hundreds of recorded instances where
          it was done with intent of evil.—Phila­
          delphia Times.

          Things That Afl'eet tlie Hypnotic State,
          The differences in the climates appear
          to have great influence on hypnotic SUA*
          ceptibility. Southerners and altogether
          those who have been exposed to the
          tropical heat are much more easily in*
          fluenced than those who live in the tem­
          perate or frigid zones. Hypnosis not
          only appears sooner in the tropical cli­
          mates, but it is usually deeper, and the
          more complicated conditions of the
          states invariably appear immediately.
          The hypnotic susceptibility does not de­
          pend on these circumstances alone.
          There are many other conditions which
          we must find partly outside of the indi­
          vidual and partly within. It is neces­
          sary to especially notice the different
          tempers of mind, such as delight, sor­
          row, etc.
          What also works against comipg into
          the hypnotic state is overexertion, either
          mentally or bodily, an empty or over­
          loaded stomach, excessive use of certain
          nourishing substances, liquors, strong
          spices, coffee or tea. All these condi­
          tions more or less prevent or disturb the
          coming hypnosis. Furthermore, out­
          ward influences, such as temperature,
          dress, place of residence and surround­
          ings, should all be considered. The
          room in which experiments are to be
          performed must neither be too warm nor
          too cold.—Chicago Herald.

          Hypnotism and Its Relation to Crime.
          None are more bigoted than infidels.
          The science of a generation ago was
          proud of its infidelity. Without a dem
          onstration in (acts it would believe
          nothing; nor, indeed, beyond its nar
          row physical range did it desire to see
          anything, to know anything:. No Span
          ish padre in Mm train of Isabella, no
          exhorting captain of Cromwell's pray
          erful warriors, no hadji at the well of
          Zem-Zem, was ever blinder to enlight
          enment, more invincible to argument.
          In the opinion of tnia scientific omnis
          cience, astrology, witchcraft, magic,
          omens, premonitions, spiritualism, clair
          voyance, mesmerism, personal magnet
          ism and ghosts were alike ridiculous
          and incredible. These alleged phenom
          ena could not be brought under the
          microscope nor submitted to the rule of
          three. They were therefore impossible
          in both the English and the French
          sense of the word. This arrogant,
          bigoted devotion to the purely physical
          exhibited none of the lofty ideality of
          that pure, if uninstructed, soul who
          exciat&ed "I believe it, because it is
          impossible!" These scientists were "of
          the earth, earthy."
          1 test limit Truth could not, however,
          lone endure this degradation. The
          things undreamt of by iiuratio existed
          nevvriliuless. They will always exist:
          nor will ignoring them obliterate them.
          Science accused Religion of believing
          too much, but Science herself believed
          too little. To fall by dark into a ditch
          and believe it a well may not be sensi
          ble; to ignore that you are in the ditch
          because you cannot see it, is scarcely
          iiiur« reasonable.
          The rebound of this great intellectual
          movement has, perhaps, already «oue
          too far. We have become as fond of
          mysteries as a priest of Thebes. We
          believe all that our grandfathers be
          lieved, and much that those venerable
          men would have ridiculed. As childreu
          around the dying tire, we must have our
          tfliost storius before we sleep. Solemn
          London editors gravely describe the
          mysterious pictures that present them
          selves in a ball of crystal to the eyes of
          the editors' female friends. The editors
          themselves cannot see these pictures,
          but, of course, they exist. Nobody
          would deny that. Thought transference
          is an established fact. The young man
          reflects uitrhtly upon the superexcel
          ieuce of his fiancee, and he is sure that
          Marie smiles responsive in her dreams.
          The virtues of faith cure are self-evi
          dent. Only beliova that the forceps are
          made of sponge, and you will never
          know when the tooth is cut.
          But the greatest of these new beliefs
          is hypnotism. Its growth bids tair to
          divide the nation. From recent events
          it would seem that some Democrats
          have already disappeared, and soon
          there will be no Republicans. The
          "iniquitous doctrines" of the Hypnotiz
          ers will be assailed ore long la the na
          tioual platform of the Hypnotized.
          Everywhere intrudes the hypnotic
          "suggestion." We may think we paid
          a delicate compliment to the rector, but
          tii c wife of our bosom put it into our
          head. Little Reginald was "thinkin' of
          them Christmas presents rigbtalong."
          But to th« criminal, the condemned of
          man, comes the new doctrine as a
          heavenly aid. The glories of iisanity
          are past. It is not now conceded that
          Mr. Brown, of i'psilanti, who killed his
          neighbor Rogers, should be at once dis
          charged because th« town records of
          Boston recall the incarceration of an
          ancestral Brown "forasmuch as lie was
          distraught of his intellects."
          The new method is much simpler,
          much easier. The cashier robs a great
          bank systematically for years. He was
          perfectly honest himself, but was under
          the control of another man, who got
          most of the money. A scoundrel slays
          an innocent woman through a hired as
          sassin. The actual murderer had the
          best intentions, but he cou'd not help
          adopting the elaborate plan proposed by
          the hypnotizing villain. The plan was
          known to intelligent men, but they were
          "hypnotized," and could no.t warn the
          victim. Various girls elope with mar
          ried men, but they are "model young
          ladies" under hypnotic influence.
          If all these things are true, anarchy is
          already upon us. bins Sins and J oliet
          are our proper universities. Matters,
          however, might be exaggerated—by the
          other newspapers. A late inquiry among
          prominent local representatives of tho
          medical and legal professions has been
          most reassuring. The following com
          munications exhibit the true nature of
          hypnotism and its possible relations to
          crime. The articles set forth the most
          recent and approved views upon a dif
          ficult and complicated subject, and ex
          emplify the heights to which have risen
          the sciences of Galen and Triboniau,
          PROF. W. XAVIER SUDDUTH.
          University of Minnesota.
          In answer to your letter of inquiry re
          garding the relation of hypnosis to
          crime, would say that 1 no not consider
          that there is any relation, and in proof
          i>t my position cite the fact that hypno
          tism is as old as man and has been
          known as far back as Biblical record
          goes- The Egyptians also were familiar
          with it, and so have been all modern
          nations; but in all this time, so far a3
          my knowledge extends, there has not
          been a single well-authenticated case
          on the criminal records of any country
          where hypnosis has been used to coiu
          del any one to commit any crime, not a
          single case where a pre viously virtuous
          woman hns been led from the path of
          virtue, nor any individual swindled out
          of money by means of hypnotic sugges
          tion, nor do I believe there ever will be.
          Hypnosis is not a condition like ether
          or chloroform narcosis, but a mental
          state into which the individual volun
          tarily enters. No one can be hypno
          tised against his will, nor be kept in the
          hypnotic state any longer than he is
          willing to be. The Idea that many per
          sons have that only weak-minded people
          can be hypnotized is entirely false. The
          best subjects I have ever had have been
          this best educated and possessed of the
          strongest wills. All that is necessary
          for such people to do In order to become
          subjects is to desire to <\\i>erience the
          sensation and put themselves in a stale
          of absolute passivity.
          Idiots, insane people and skeptics can
          not be hypnotized. In order to be a
          good subject a person must first be will
          ing—he must have will power sufficient
          to will to do as he is told, and last, but
          not least, be must possess faith in the
          operator.
          Mo one can bo hypnotized who do.-s
          not know that he is going to be.
          The process is purely one of suggestion.
          There is no mysterious fluid that passes
          from one individual to the other.
          Neither is it a condition of paralysis,
          in which the individual is unable
          to resist the will of the operator.
          The suggestion of acts to a person in the
          hypnotic state that are contrary to his
          ideas of right and wrong will always
          meet with failure, and if the sugges
          tion is persisted in will cause the indi
          vidual to awaken. Constant repetition
          may, as iv the waking state, educate
          him iv the premises, but a person iv
          the hypnotic state is less susceptible to
          criminal suggestion than ho wuuhl be
          in the waking condition, for th» reason
          that in the hypnotic state nil sense of
          material relations is set aside for tho'
          time being. The personality of the in
          dividual la not, however, materially al
          tered, only Modified, partially domi
          nated hy the will ol another for the time
          being, but only in so far as his own
          ideas of rieht and wrong are not seri
          ously crossed. Any strong countor
          cturent of ideas will break the relation
          ship nnd arouse him from the. hypnotic
          state.
          Furthermore, there must be a condi
          tion of absolute sympathy and confi
          dence presented in order to secure' the
          best results. Faith in the ability and'
          good intentions of the operator is an 'es- 1
          Mattel element in hypnotism. No sane
          person would go to sleep with a burglar
          under his bed if he knew it, neither
          would he permit a rascal to hypnotize
          him. The sensational stories that go the
          rounds of cheap literature regarding
          theft, arson and murder committed in
          the hypnotic state, by reason of that
          state, are the creations of diseased
          minds. Unless a person is a thief or
          murderer at heart, he can no more be
          made one in the hypnotic than he can in
          the waking state, in considering this
          subject, however, it must b» remem
          bered that there are people in the world
          who are negatively virtuous and gener
          ally well behaved—people who are good
          simply because they have never been
          tempted to be bad. Such persons,
          tempted either in the waking or hyp
          notic state, might or would fall
          simply because they have no In
          dwelling force of character. Such
          people are only safe in a cloister or be
          liir.a prison bars, and there, in my esti
          mation, is where a considerable portion
          of the inhabitants of a village in a
          neighboring state should be placed. If
          wo can believe the accounts in the
          papers, an innocent man is being perse
          cuted at the Instigation of two hysterical
          girls who have the power of throwing
          themselves into the trance state. The
          days of Salem witchcraft are being en
          acted over again. 1 have never seen
          anything yet in my fifteen years' study
          of the subject that has led me to believe
          in telepathy, and I fully concur in the
          opinion of Judge Bailey as to the ad
          mission of •'hypnotically" secured testi
          mony in court.
          The basis of hypnotism is suggestion,
          and this may be given in the waking as
          well as the hypnotic state, and need not
          be by word alone. Anything that stands
          for an idea to the mind of the indi
          vidual is sufficient to produce the
          effect. Suggestions in the waking
          state sometimes produce epidem
          ics, as in the middle ages, when
          men, women and children were carried
          away by the miliion with the idea of
          of rescuing the Holy city. Epidemics
          of crime seem to spring up as the result
          of some dastardly deed as the incentive.
          "Lynching bees" follow each other in
          rapid succession. Train robberies go
          in groups, although widely separated
          geographically. To sucii an extent do
          these things occur that sometimes .it
          seems as if people were ere atures «f im
          pulse and suggestion rather than rea
          soning beings.
          The danger in hypnosis lies in its
          abuse, and not in its use. Every power
          has its good and its bad aspect, and so
          has this one; but hypnosis offers its own
          remedy. If, when abused,* hypnosis
          may weaken the will,even as morphine,
          ether, chloral and all other narcotics, rt
          may also be used to strengthen the will
          again, whereas'the other analgesics can
          not. No one has ever diod from hyp
          nosis used as an aosesthetic, while
          hundreds have died under chloroform.
          My prediction is that, when the atmos
          phere has been cleared of supersti
          tion, bigotry and professional jealousy,
          hypnosis will come into general use as
          an analgesic and anaesthetic To inhibit
          or even limit the use of this potent
          remedy for the relief of pain would be
          an outrage upon the community. Far
          better educate the people up to its right
          use and point out the danger of its
          abuse.
          If it is to be controlled by legislation,
          where will the line be drawn? Let me
          cite a few places where it is now used.
          A little child is playing with Its blocks
          or dollies, aud the nurse enters to put
          the little one into its crib for its regular
          afternoon nap. The child does not feel
          sleepy, but insists on being allowed to
          finish the house he is building, but the
          nurse persists, and by blandishment*
          and promises ot sugar plums finally
          succeeds in tretting the child into its
          crib or into her lap, and then begins the
          monotonous motion of rocking it to
          sleep, meanwhile emphasizing the
          suggestion by the low droning of the
          lullaby song accompanied by the com
          maud: "Go to sleep, darling—go to
          sieep sleep sleep"—and the child
          "iocs" to sleep—hypnotized.
          Again, a child at its play In
          some way hurts its finger, and
          runs to mamma, crying: the moth
          er soothes away the pain by ca
          resses and diversion of the attention,
          and in all probability, if injury is con
          siderable, ending by rocking and sing
          intr it to sleep while the tears yet glis
          ten between its closed lids.
          In yonder darkened chamber lies a
          person suffering from that terribly
          painful affliction —"a sick head
          ache"—the slightest jar giving ex
          cruciating agony, such as is to be
          appreciated only by one who has
          had it. A friend, hearing of the case,
          comes in, and by gently stroking the
          fevered brow soon quiets the throbbing
          pulse and puts the sufferer to aleep, to
          awake entirely free from pain.
          A person suffuringifrom an acute neu
          ralgia, caused an by exposed pulp in a de
          cayed tooth, calls upon me at my house in
          the evening. I apply some simple house
          hold remedy, and, by a tew gentle but
          firm passes over the face in the painful
          region, suggest freedom from pain, and
          send the sufferer home to pass a com
          fortable night in sleep, instead of walk
          ing the floor, as many a person has done.
          A prominent man, whose voice, no
          doubt, will be heard in the halls ot our
          legislature the coming winter on this
          subject, if it comes up, recently went
          to a "painless joint" and had twoachiiur
          teeth removed with odontuader, or
          something of a like nature, and after
          wards suffered intense neuralgia. He
          Bought me at my home just at dinner
          time. 1 applied topical remedies, but
          failed to relieve him. I finally suggested
          hypnosis, and, placing him upon a
          lounge in my study, soon had him
          asleep, and left him to rest until 1 could
          tret my dinner. On returning I found
          him awake, the pain having oeen
          stronger than my au^estiou to sleep
          I again hypnotized him, and remained
          with him, finally securing immunity
          from the neuralgia, and sent him home
          to a quiet night's rest, a firm believer
          hi the efficacy of hypnosis as an anal*
          gesic.
          A lady came to the late clinic at
          the university with a tumor of long
          standing, the removal of which had
          been a constant dread, undermining
          her health and inducing morbid nerv
          ous symptom*. The tumor was
          successfully removed under hyp
          nosis, and the patient subsequently
          treated for her nervousness.with marked
          improvement and promise of final cure
          A woman stiffenmk from a known
          heart lesion, who had permitted her
          teeth to decay to the jjum line tHjcauso
          an anesthetic had been inteudicted by
          hei family physician, presented for
          treatment. She proved a Kd subject,
          and had a lance number of badly dis~
          eased teeth and roots removed under
          hypnosis, waking up vvitli a smile on
          her face, having been perfectly obliv
          ious to auy paiu, and remained free
          from any subsequent bad effects of neu
          ralgia or shock.
          A man suffering from hysterio-er>i
          lepsy of several years' standing
          presented for treatment. {Suppur
          ation of the antrum and frontal
          sinuses was diagnosed, and, as these
          cases coutraindicate the ordinary an
          aesthetics, hypnosis wan used in the
          presence of several physicians with
          absolute success and tubes placed in the
          several sinuses. The operation was
          followed np by the use of suggestion in
          the treatment of the epileptic attacks,
          and, although the case is still under
          treatment, every indication points to a
          cuie. The epileptic seizures are
          under full control, and all internal
          Medication has been dropped these
          many days.
          A woman in the fifth month of a
          "vomiting pregnancy," with other
          serious complications, wasted to a
          shadow, and only existing on three
          quarters ot a grain of morphine
          daily, administered hypodermatically,
          was put under hypnotic control, and
          the morphine stopped at the second
          sitting. At the third site was taught to
          hypnotize herself. The vomiting was
          treated L*y suggestion, as well as some
          other annoying complications, and the
          patient remains to this day, nearly one
          month since the first treatment, free
          from the use of morphine, a"iid doing as
          well as .could be expected of one iv her
          condition.
          A large number of stammerers have
          also come under my treatment, with
          varying decrees of success; none,
          however, witnout improvement, and
          several have been dismissed as
          cured. In the licht ot tlie above expe
          rience, of which the cases cited are only
          examples, is it strange that I should be
          a firm believer in hypnosis as an anal
          tesie and an aim-schetic in the treat
          ment of neuralgia? The following
          clippiug from the New York Evening
          Post very clearly sets forth the present
          status of hypnosis in its relation to med
          icine:
          The extent to which therapeutic experi
          ments in hypnotic suggestion are exciting
          the attention of physicians and awakening
          the interest of the general public may be in
          ferred from the fact that during: the past
          year more than 100 books and brochures,
          especially devoted to the discussion of this
          subject, have been published. One of the
          most valuable of these is the small volume
          just issued by Bong, in Berlin, entitled "Die
          Bedeutuug der Uynotischen Suggestion als
          Ileilmittel." The author. Dr. J. Grossman,
          editor of the Zeitschrift fur Hypotismus,
          prints communications from thirty of the
          most eminent professors and physicians ot
          Europe, firing the results of their experi
          ence in the application of hypnotic sugges
          tions to the healing of disease. Thus Van
          .'edeu and Van Reuterghem. of Amsterdam,
          report that from May 5,1557, to June 30, 1893,
          in the institution under their charge, 1.098
          patients were subjected to the treatment;
          of those £8.28 percent were entirely cured.
          2&6!) per cent permanently improved, 21.02
          per cent slightly bettered, 17.81 per cent
          unaffected, and in U.lB per cent of the
          cases the results were unknown. Dr.
          Wetterstrand, of Stockholm, has used this
          method of medical treatment in 7,000, and
          Dr. Bornneim, of Nancy, in 12,000 cases, and
          both express themselves strongly in favor of
          it. Indeed, Dr. Bernheim does not hesitate
          to declare that the study of Hypnotic sugges
          tion should be made obligatory in all medical
          school?, and that nowadays a physician who
          ignores the psychical element in disease, and
          has no knowledge of the part it plays in
          palhogeny and therapeutics, is no better
          than a horse doctor, and should confine him
          self to veterinary practice. Another impor
          tant point brought out by Dr. Kraltt-Ebing,
          of Vienna, is the influence of "a utosugges
          tion" in the production of disease. The
          number of ailments and morbid conditions
          of this) kind, that have their origin in the
          nervous system, and are indicated by pains,
          paralysis and other symptoms of hysterical,
          hypochondriac and neurasthenic affections,
          is astonishing. Although not merely i mag
          inary complaints, they cease with the re
          moval of the "autosuargestive cause," which
          may be effected by any change of scene ban
          ishing it from the thoughts, or by heterosug
          gestion (fremd-suggestlon) on the part of a
          physician, who may impart it verbally or in
          the disguise of a dose of medicine. In obsti
          nate cases, in which the autosuggestion is
          firmly entrenched in mental imbecility, su
          perstituiion, morbid appetites and passions,
          inveterate habits, or abnormities of charac
          ter, recourse must be had to hypnotism. That
          the great majority of mankind are capable of
          being hypnotized is shown by the experi
          ments of Dr. Freihorr yon Schrank Noizing,
          of Munich, on 5.705 persons of different na
          tionalities, of whom only per cent proved
          to be entirely unsusceptible."
          The following paragraph is taken
          from a letter of mine published in the
          Minneapolis Journal:
          "I have observed from a perusal of the
          literature on the- sub ject that nearly al! the
          work done so far has been in the direction
          of investigating its value as a therapeutic
          agent, rather than as au an a-sthetie. Tiie
          special line of work that I have been and am
          still engaged upon is its application to sur
          gery, upon which little or nothing has been
          written. The value of hypnosis as an anal
          gesic in neuralgia has long been known.
          That I entered uuon the work with consid
          erable trepidation is shown by the fact that,
          although I have been a close student of the
          subject formauy years past, aud have uieJ it
          in my private practice, yet I bad never given
          a public demonstration until last year. I
          cannot do belter in closing this letter than to
          quote the opening paragraph of the first
          paper I ever wrote upon the subject: "The
          liae of detnarkaiiou between the sublime aud
          the ridiculous, between the mysterious ana
          the miraculous, Between belief and iucredu
          l.ty, between respect and diversion in this life,
          is so narrow that to espouse auy causa that
          is not woll understood, or in at verges on tne
          occult, is really dangerous to oue's reputa
          tion; and la treating of hypnosis I should be
          vain Indeed did did I expect to escape the
          lot of others who have iv the past essayed
          the role of interpreters of ibis ruueh-abused,
          but Httle understood, science.' 1 The clinic

          strated its value as au amesthetic. It was
          fitting that a dental clinic stiould bo the first
          10 take the lead in the maUor, us dentistry
          has always b'en in the front rank iv ex peri
          meiu with aiuesthetics, and with excellent
          results.' 1
          I As to who can use hypnosis there is
          no limit. All are more or less suscepti
          ble to its influence. All that the hyp
          notizer can do is to direct the course to
          be pursued,and the result depends upon
          the Individual. I have taught a great
          many persons to hypnotize themselves,
          to their great benefit. When it is fully
          understood that it is a mental state and
          not a physical condition, ana that no
          one can bo hypnotized against his will,
          then tho dread that some good pcoDle
          have of it will cease, and hypnotic sug
          gestion will come to occupy th place it
          deservedly should among household
          remedies.

          As to whether the law recognizes an
          alleged hypnotic influence, under which
          a crime was committed, as being a de
          fense fur the party charged with the
          commission of such crime, 1 will say
          that, so far as the existence of the con
          dition called hypnotism is concerned, or
          whether it exists as a condition or as a
          fact. lam unable to state. From what
          is said about it ami written about it, it
          aDpears that some people have the fac
          ulty of producing on others an influ
          ence called hysterical or hypnotic, un
          der which the subject apparently ap
          pears to have abandoned all self-power
          and self-consciousness, and to be en
          tirely under the domination of the op
          erator.
          But so far the law has nol, recognized
          the existence of any such condition;
          that is, it has not been satisfactorily
          proven ift any court of justice, to my
          knowledge, that either tbe operator
          possesses the alleged power, or that the
          subject can be entirely subordinated to
          the will of the operator to the extent
          that it is claimed that he can—that is, so
          as to produce an abnormal condition in
          which the individuality of the subject is
          completely wiped out, and he or she be
          comes the more instrument of the de
          sires or wishes of the operator.
          Now, I say the law does not recognize
          the existence of that condition; there
          fore, up to this time, there is, so far as 1
          know, no adjudicated case which holds
          that a defense based upon a theory that
          a criminal act was committed by one
          because of and while under the power
          of hypnotic influence can be sustained.
          I very much doubt whether such a de
          fense ever will b« sustained, because I
          do not tluiik the law will ever recogniz
          a hypnotic condition as a defense to a
          criminal act committed by one who
          claims to be in that state when so
          committing the crime. Neither would
          the law recognize, without a direct
          statutory enactment in that behalf, a
          criminal act committed by the operator
          in the hypnotic suggestion. In other
          words, to make it plain, if it should be
          claimed that the operator hypnotized
          the subject, and then, while the subject
          was under the influence, suggested to
          the subject the commission of a crime,
          which such person so under the influence
          should then proceed to commit, the legal
          consequences would be, very likely, that
          both of them would be indicted for the
          crime and both Dunislied as principal
          and accessory both before and after the
          fact.
          You now ask me whether the hypno
          tizing of a person against his will,
          winch results in the mental or physical
          injury of the person so hypnotized,
          would be considered in law a crime.
          Under the penal code of this state there
          is no provision that will reach such a
          e.ise that lam aware of. As this state
          has abolished common law jurisdiction
          for crimes, and nothing is a crime unless
          so specifically designated iv the statutes
          (and we have no statute upon the sub
          ject of hypnotism or occult Influence),
          there could be no charge predicated upon
          the hypnotizing of an individual, pro
          vided the subject consented to the ex
          periment; but if it should be proved iv
          court that such a thing as hypnotic in
          fluence existed, and that a person was
          hypnotized against his will, thereby
          producing a physical injury to him, 1
          should think that certainly, under the
          common law jurisdiction, and, perhaps,
          under our penal code, a prosecution for
          assault might be maintained, for it has
          been held that the administration of
          anesthetics to a patient against his will
          do's constitute an assault.
          Speaking generally of the subject, the
          most remarkable thing connected with
          the so-called hypnotic manifestations is
          the resemblance which they bear to the
          old theories of witchcraft, both in Eu
          rope and iv this country.
          The alleged case of hypnotism re
          cently occurring in Eau Claire, and the
          manifestations of the hypnotic subjects,
          as reported in the Globs on last Sun
          day, are remarkably similar to the man
          ifestations of witchcraft delusion as we
          read them, both in the histories of Eu
          rope and of New England. The state
          ments of the two girls in Eau Claire
          concerning the Influence of J)r. Pickin,
          and the hysterical or cataleptic con
          dition which they ascribe to his in
          fluence, are almost precisely the same
          as the manifestations of witchcraft aud
          the charges made against those unfor
          tunate people that are alleged to have
          practiced the art In New England dur
          ii.sr the early history of the country.
          When you add to this the sympathetic
          symptoms between the two s-irls, you
          have, if you choose to call it so, a case of
          witchcraft or possession produced by
          witchcraft, or absolutely similar symp
          toms; and it is a very remarkable thing
          that in tiie year 18U4, at what we consider
          the acme of our development in civili
          zation, progress and culture, we should
          find ourselves confronted with a condi
          tion, or popular delusion, which has
          heretofore been entirely ascribed to the
          ignorance and superstition of former
          ages.
          You ask me if a confession or testi
          mony obtained under hypnotic Influence
          could be used in a court of law, or would
          the procuring of a confession under surh
          circumstances be a violation of personal
          right. The entire value of a confession
          rests upon the eireumstamces under
          which it is obtained. It must be volun
          tary, and not induced by undue influence
          of any kind. The mind of the party
          confessing must not be overcome Liy any
          influence such as threats, or hope of re
          ward or of escaping punishment. It
          therefore follows that a confession
          obtained from a person who, it
          is conceded, was at the time unable to
          contiol his own faculties, would be
          worthless, nor would a person under
          what is called hypnotic influence be
          permitted to testify in a court of com
          mon law while in that condition, if such
          condition were known to the court. 11 a
          person BeSerinf under temporary or
          permanent aberration of mind is dis
          qualified as a witness, so would a per
          son be who waa under the influence
          either of narcotics or intoxicants to such
          an extent as to atlect his judgment. If
          you once assume that a person can be
          placed under hypnotic influence and the
          law should recognize it, it would cer
          tainly disqualify that person from testi
          fying while in that condition.
          HON. CHARLES E. FLANDRAU.
          On the subject of hypnotism 1 know
          nothing, and do not suppose any one
          knows any more than I do, therefore 1
          will say nothing about it.
          As to whether the plea of having been
          under hypnotic influence at tho time of
          the commission of a crime would be re
          ceived by a court as a defense, all I can
          say is to Quote a very familiar principle
          in criminal law, winch is that intention
          is Mm gist of oil crime. No ohm can be
          guilty of a crime unless lie perpetrated
          it knowingly. Responsibility for ciime
          depends wholly upon intention.
          A familiar instance of this principle i
          is the. plea of insanity, if the party is
          insane when the act is committed, he is
          not himself, is not impelled b\ his own i
          reason, but by some delusion thai clouds
          bn mind and destroys his will. .So he j
          is not held responsible for his act.
          If any one person possesses the power
          of absolutely controlling the actions of
          another (which [seriously doubt, unless
          such other is so mentally diseased as to
          be generally irresponsible), and should
          by such influence and power impel such
          person to commit a crime. tii«?n, of
          course, the one exerting the influence
          would be the criminal, and not the party
          performing the involuntary act. This
          is on the principle that he acted without
          intention on hi* part, but by an irre
          sistible impulse exerted by another.
          Whether courts will accept any ex
          pert evidence on a matter of this kind.
          1, of course, am unable to say; but. in
          the light of experience, science and
          common sense, I think they should be
          very careful In listening to anything of
          the kind.

          A great deal of nonsense has been
          printed in the daily press lately about
          hypnotism, «nd people generally seem
          willing to set hardly any limit to the
          powers of the dreadful individuals who
          "influence," in accordance with their
          own sweet will, any and everybody with
          whom they come into contact, and be
          fore whom neither virtue, life nor prop
          erty is supposed to be safe. If one may

          USES OF THE POWER
          VEN HYPNOSIS
          may now be pro
          duced by machinery.
          We are approaching
          a day when the di
          rect influence of
          Svengalles will not
          be necessary to
          throw Trilbies Into
          subjective at ate a.
          when hypnotists will
          exert their powers
          through machinery
          set to operate at
          given times, the
          presence of the Instruments being un
          known to the subjects. The mechanical
          mesmerizer will then find an essential
          place In the burglar's tool kit, and we will
          have to look under our beds to see If such
          traps have been set by our enemies. The
          mechanical hypnotizer as now made, how
          ever, is strictly a scientific instrument.
          The government's bureau of education re
          cently purchased a collection of such appar
          atus, which are new In this country. They
          will be used by a specialist for studying
          the values of hypnotic suggestion in the
          education of the abnormal classes. Ex
          periments will be made determining their
          effect upon the sensibilities, emotions,
          breathing,. circulation and temperature of
          the body'.
          An Elaborate Apparatus.
          The most elaborate form of hypnotiser
          is a small box, containing clock work, sur
          mounted by two horizontal oblong fans,
          one over the other, revolving rapidly In op
          posite directions. The fans are studded
          on each side with a row of circular mir
          rors, about the size of nickel pieces. The
          rapid rotation produces an odd flashing
          effect which greatly fatigues the eyelid
          muscles of the beholder. This machine is
          found to be very effective when used upon
          sersitives who can be thrown into a hyp
          notic sleep by concentration or sight stimu
          lus.
          A simpler form of mechanical hypnotizer
          is a belt of broad tape to be placed upon
          the forehead and over the temples, being
          tied at the back of the head. From a me
          tallic plate In front protrudes a wire, ex
          terding upward In an S-like curve and
          holding a bright ball of nickel, about the
          size of a marble, at the end. When this is
          placed upon the st'bject the wire Is bent
          until the ball reaches a point above the
          eye, where it may be seen by the wearer
          only by intensely straining the eyelids.
          The same effect, as produced by the former
          rr achine is accomplished by this simpler ap
          paratus. These instruments have been
          Irvented to serve in substitution for the
          gestures, known as passes, commonly ma
          by hypnotists. The scientific hypnotist
          makes movements before and above tho
          eyes of his subject to concentrate his at
          tention and to fatigue the eyelid muscles
          both by causing the eyes to follow the
          movements and by fannirig air against
          them. Fatigue of the muscles of the eye
          lids is found to he one of the direct causes
          of sleep. Persons in no mental need of sleep
          may "read themselves sleepy" under a too
          bright or a too (im light. A severe breeze
          against the eyelids will cause the same
          effect.
          Magnetic Influentea.
          Another form of hypnotizer, in this col
          lection, is a large horshoe magnet with an
          attached armature. It is given to a sensi
          tive who is told to continuously separate
          and fit together the two parts. A similar
          magnetic hypnotizer is a steel ring to fit
          the index finger. The ring is of magnetized
          steel and is broken at one place, the space
          being filled by a small steel armature.
          These two contrivances are used princi
          pally for humoring the more unsophisti
          cated and superstitious sensitives who fos
          ter the belief that hypnotism is supernat
          ural. The magnet in most cases suggests
          mystery to the ignorant and sensitives of
          that class are readily excited by it. The
          ring device, also called a hypnoscope, Is
          used by some hypnotists for determining
          sensitives. Hypnotizable persons are al
          leged to experience certain tinglings in the
          skin and twitchings of the muscles while
          wearing it. A more complicated instru
          ment in this collection, which may be used
          as a hypnoscope, is a bulb-shaped rod, re
          sembling an electrode, which may be
          made to create pressure against the
          palm of the hand by a spring inside. When
          the pressure Is applied the subject is asked
          if he feels an electric shock. If he so con
          fesses he is rated as a hynotic sensitive.
          Sometimes the whole frame will tremble
          as a result of this imaginary electrical
          fluid.
          Crystal Viaions.
          Equally interesting devices of a related
          class, now growing in vogue among certain
          experimental hypnotists, are for applica
          tion to sensitives for the purpose of caus
          ing hallucinations known as crystal visions.
          One instrument of this class is a ball of
          crystal mounted upon a handle. Mirrors
          and other polished or transparent surfaces
          are employed for the same effect. The
          crystal or reflecting medium by producing
          partly obscured or scattered reflections to
          the sensitive mind's eye aid the subje-t
          in perceiving unnatural mental embodi
          ments of various objects. Many abnormal
          persons, habitually haunted by phantasms,
          for which visions they develop appetites,
          so to speak, employ these crystals and re
          flectors for throwing themselves into states
          during which they may experience what Is
          alleged to be the actual or imagined "sixth
          sense" or "second sight." Crystal gazing
          has lately become so popular that many
          psychic experimentalists in Europe are in
          viting tests with the paraphernalia thus
          employed, and agents were some time
          since engaged by the Society for Psychical
          Research to furnish balls for the purpose.
          Prof. Win. Romaine Newbold of the Uni
          versity 'of Pennsylvania recently made an
          extensive Investigation of crystal vision
          and found that twenty-two subjects out of
          eighty-six could perceive illusions by gaz
          ing into mirrors, surfaces of water- and
          objects of glass varying in form. Phan
          tasms appeared to the sensitives usually
          within five minutes, being prec~ed direct
          ly by cloudiness, hazes of color or illumin
          ations before the eyes. The phantasms
          varied from dim outlines to brilliant col
          ored pictures. Like dreams some of these
          forms were based upon recent experiences
          of the subjects, while others were purely
          fantastic.
          An Experiment.
          A simple experiment in thi\ line may be
          tried at home by any one who *11 sit before
          an open window, at twilight, keeping his
          gaze fixed preferably upon some landscape,
          distant row of houses or collection of con
          spicuous clouds. If the temptation to wink
          the eyelids can be resisted until the eyes
          become greatly fatigued, so as to remain
          open only at a great strain, the natural
          images will gradually grow more and more
          indistinct, and will apparently arrange
          themselves into fantastic groups or fade in
          to rapidly changing forms. The abnormal
          imagination of a person subject to Uight
          hallucinations would readily discern weird
          phantoms in such a picture.
          Drugs, such as urethane, suiphonal, peaa
          dehyde, etc., are now used successfully to
          produce a sleep which to all appearances is
          hypnotic. Some foreign hypnotists use
          ether and chloroform to induce hypnosis.
          Recent experiments indicate that there is
          a great similarity between hypnosis and theI
          action of hasheesh,as well as the newly test
          ed mescal, which is used by certain of our
          western Indians to produce trances. Phe
          nomena very similar to hypnosis is now
          noticed also during the ordinary sleep pro
          duced by simple anaesthetics, and the ques
          tion is being asked, Do anaesthetics produce
          hypnosis? A member of the Royal Chemi
          cal Society of London recently demonstrated
          that man possesses two distinct conscious
          nesses. He says that persons under the in
          fluence of anaesthetics. while not conscious
          of what is happening at the time of the
          operation, are sometimes able, several days
          after, to describe in detail what was hap
          pnnto e them. Wrhat he.n call t.."o

          conductors controlling the latter conscious
          ness. It may be that this "subliminal con
          sciousness" is the one affected by hypnot
          ists.
          Senlttve to Drmss.
          Recent laboratory experiments have also
          been made to ascertain the effects of drugs
          upon persons in a hypnotic state. Some
          subjects are found to be so sensitive to
          drugs while in this condition that they con
          tort themselves in various ways when the
          substances are not applied directly, but
          merely held in proximity to their skin, not
          even touching it. Some chemical substanc+-s,
          even when sealed in tubes, will cause sen
          sitives to alter their bodily appearances and

          vulsions, hallucinations, alterations of the

          The influence of color upon hypnotized
          persons has also been tested in the labo
          ratcry by subjecting sensitives to rays of
          light passing through various screens of
          different colored glass. Blue light is found
          to produce sadness, red light joy, yellow
          light strong sffection and violet or green
          light variable conditions. Charcot used a
          sudden ray of Intense light as one means
          or throwing sensitives into the hypnotic
          state.
          Just as these instruments for producing
          hypnosis are applied to the sense of sight,
          other physical methods are applied, in its
          induction, to the senses of hearing and
          touch. The condition does not seem to be
          induced by stimulations of either taste smell. Charcot threw some of his subjects
          into hypnotic states by the sharp and
          sudden sounding of a large gong. The
          ticking of a watch has been used with
          the same success by others, the sensitive
          being required to concentrate his mind
          upon the sound. just as he does upon the
          seeing of the revolving fans or nickel ball.
          The monotonous chants sung by semi
          civilized nations are found to produce the
          same effect.
          Strokes and Passes.
          For creating hypnosis through the sense
          of touch, strokings or pressure upon the
          skin are resorted to by some hypnotists,
          while others apply warm plates of metal
          to different parts of the body. Physicians
          realize that warmth induces natural sleep,
          while coldness tends to prevent it. Some
          foreign hypnotists maintain that the crown
          of the head, roof of the nose, the thumb
          or elbow are most sensitive to hypnotic
          stimulation by touch. Some merely
          s'ratch the skin of the neck or touch the
          forehead. The electric battery has been
          resorted to by a few experimenters, who
          claim that it is successful. as an inducing
          agent. It is said to cause the same imag
          inary effect as the magnet.
          It is now an easy matter for certain hyp
          niotists to transform natural sleep into
          hypnotic sleep without the subject's knowl
          edge. Thus one .who gces to sleep in a
          public place may never remember what
          foolish actions he has been made to do
          Ouring that period. Hypnotic suggestion is
          the latest phase of this whole subject which
          is now interesting experimenters. A sensi
          tive, under hypnotic influence, receives a
          command fram the hypnotist which he
          will obey on awakening, altough he is un
          (onsciou of ever having received such a
          (ommand. This power is used by a physi
          cian in Massachusetts, who is said to be
          able to stop the most severe pain by sug
          gestion. Several people report to the Soci
          ety for Psychical Research that he has
          given thcm suggestions before they have
          gone to the dentist, %ith the result that
          their dentstry has invariably been painless,
          kxperiments are now being made as to the
          valu. of hypnotic suggestion in education.
          Its medical value has already neen proven
          in France. where such conditions as ner
          vous insomnia, sonambulism, kleptomania,
          ilziness and varicus forms of moral degen
          eracy have been cured by its means.
          Ues of Hypnosis.
          The power of suggestic n as an agent in
          crime is now being talked about in this
          country. Men are believed to have been
          banged for committing murder while acting
          under hypnotic Influence from another.
          Some celebrated medico-legalists have pro
          posed that laws should be passed defining
          the responsible murderers in such cases.
          In such an event hypnotism will be as both
          ersome a plea of defense as insanity is to
          day. The dangers threatened by the vicious
          or careless hypnotist have become legally
          realized In France and Russia. In the
          former hypnotism is forbidden for purposes
          of public amusement, and in the latter no
          persons except, licensed physicians can
          practice It It is said that tilt per cent of
          ithe people In thne world are hypnotizable.
          The hypnotists, on the other hand, are dis
          covering and improving their powers faster
          and faster each day. Will they at some
          future century become the governing class

          HYPNOTISM IN A VERY PAINFUL DENTAL OPERATION
          Bvj a J4ere WaVe of tke jiarxd Ir\ter\se
          Suffering Was pVeVerxted
          In the rooms of the Stomatological Club,
          at Post and Stockton streets, on Tuesday
          afternoon last, a clinic was held in the
          presence of nearly all the members, in i
          which hypnotism was introduced as a sub
          stitute for anesthesia.
          It was an experiment and the experi
          ment was successful in the highest degree,
          insomuch that it is safe to say that it
          fixes the date of a subsidence of old and
          the beginning of entirely new methods in
          the operating-rooms of San Francisco
          dentists.
          Hypnotism is not a new thing in dentis
          try any more than it is in therapeutics. It
          has just landed in San Francisco, how
          ever preceded, to be sure, by tales of
          great successes in Paris, Berlin, London
          and New York. That San Francisco
          dentists are fully alive to the progress that
          has been making in their science and
          eager to keep the best pace that is being
          made in the world was made evident by
          the number in attendance and the inter
          est manifested in the clinic
          The demonstration was arranged by Dr.
          M. W. Levkowicz. His subject was a boy
          of 17, Alfred Boulton, a native of Victoria,
          B. C, but who has returned but a few
          weeks from a residence of some years in
          Honolulu. He was an admirable subject
          for a test of the possibilities of applied
          hypnotism, in that he was a bright-eyed,
          intelligent lad of nervous temperament,
          and in that he had a couple of very sore
          teeth.
          J. B. Earley, a teacher of hypnotism,
          was present to make the magic passes and
          show the congregated doctors how easily
          it might be done. The clinic began
          shortly after 4 o'clock, the subject or pa
          tient being placed in the red-plush chair,
          so full of terrors to the tooth-aching con
          tingent, and all of which tenors were to
          be driven away by the wave of a hand.
          But tne thing was an experiment, and
          the terrors have been long intrenched in
          tnat red-plush chair. Tney laughed at
          this mild attempt to dislodge them— at
          first they did.
          The chair was placed in a wide bay-win
          dow that extends out from an upper floor
          immediately at the corner— the southeast
          corner of Post and Stockton streets. There
          was plenty of light and platform steps sur
          rounded the chair, and on these the mem
          bers of tie society were gathered, full of
          interest. The boy took his place and Pro
          fe^-sor Earley told him to close his ejea.
          He did so. ''You cannot open them,"
          said the professor, and he could not.
          "Open them," said the professor, and be
          did "Piace your hand! together— there;
          you cannot take them apart," and he
          could not.
          "Now when I count ten you will be
          sound asleep and your sense ol feeling
          will have entirely left you, bo that you
          wili feel no »aia."
          The professor counted ten slowly and
          deliberately. The boy waited a moment
          and then opened bis eyes, quite es wide
          awake as before. The professor smiled re
          assuringly and placing his hands upon
          the boy's head, with his thumbs at the
          bridge of the nose, repeated his statement
          in quiet confidence. Still the boy looked
          up with wide-awake eyes. The terror of
          the red cliair was upon him.
          Two or three times the charm was tried
          again, but it would not work. The doctors
          watched and waited patiently enough, but
          their comments and discussions, however
          quiet, were distracting. The professor
          saw his influence slipping away. He took
          the boy out of the red chair and led him
          to a rocter in the corner, as unlike the red
          cbair as possible.
          Still the boy's eyes H
          would open. It be-
          gan to look like a ,fl
          I hopeless case. The J
          I doctors broke up in jl
          j knots and talked of
          I other things.
          Finally it was SU2- I
          gested that the pro- I
          fessor lake the sub- I
          ject into a room I
          I apart and to them- I
          selves. He did so and I
          the doctors waited I
          waited quite a little I
          j while. Then the sep- I
          arating door opened I
          and the doctor en- I
          tered, leading the I
          boy, his eyes fast H
          shut, impossible for I
          him to open them, I
          but still not asleep. I
          He was led to the I
          chair, and the profes- I
          sor told the doctors I
          to go ahead.
          "This boy is not I
          asleep," said the pro- I
          fessor. 'He is in a I
          semi-conscious state, I
          but he has nofeelin.-. I
          You can work witli I
          him with perfect free- I
          dom." He spoke to I
          the boy. "Now. my I
          boy, you will feel no I
          pain whatever. Do I
          not think of the den- I
          tist; think of me; no I
          harm will come to I
          I you; you need have I
          Ino fear; lie there I
          quietly and dream I
          pleasant dreams."
          Dr. Levkowicz be- I
          gan to work with no I
          more ado. The boy I
          responded to his in- I
          structions, opening I
          his mouth wide and I
          holding it as desired. I
          He had what the den- I
          tists call a "fungoid I
          growm 01 me pulp
          of a back molar. rffi^^s^^^^^^he
          "nerve," as it is popularly called, was ex
          posed and had filled up the large cavity of
          a decayed tooth.
          As explained afterward by the doctor
          "This is a most sensitive and painful con
          dition. To touch such a tooth under or
          dinary conditions will cause great pain,
          and dentists do not attempt to work with
          such a tooth until after two or three days,
          and then with iodine and arsenic The
          THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1896.
          THE LAST BOAT
          pulp bleeds prof us°ly upon tne slightest
          touch. Now, I wished to demonstrate
          that with the patient under the influence
          of hypnotism this painful and distressing
          growth could be removed quickly and
          without pain."
          The doctor began digging into the sensi
          tive tooth with his cold steel instruments
          with speedy and certain touch. In fifteen
          minutes the growth had been wholly re-
          Scene at the Clinic in the Rooms of the. Stomatological Club When the Hypnotic Experiment Was Made
          moved and the cavity made clean for a
          fiiling. And during those fifteen minuted
          the boy lay in the chair apparently as
          comfortable as though he were enjoying
          a siesta in a hammock. The professor
          had said at the beginning that there
          j would be a minimum of blood flow from
          i the operation. The doctor took up what
          little there was in the customary way with
          I small pellets of absorbent cotton in the
          I tooth. One of the doctors remarked that
          there seemed to be a good deal of saliva
          in the mouth. "I will stop it," said the
          professor, and he did so by merely speak
          in^ the word.
          When it was finished and the doctors
          had examined and approved and mar
          veled at the demonstration, the boy said,
          "I would like to open my eyes."
          "Oh, certainly," said the professor, "you
          may open your eyes, but you will still re
          main without pain without being sus
          ceptible to pain."
          The boy opened his eyes— as clear and
          as intelligent as when he had closed them.
          Then Doctor Frank 8. Pague stepped up
          with a pair of forceps and from the other
          side of the afflicted mouth he pulled a
          tooth. It was well planted and resisted
          at first and broke off. The doctor took
          another hold, pushed the forceps down
          hard upon the fragment remaining,
          twisted it in tbe fetching way that dentists
          have, until it yielded and came out. It
          was then discovered to have an ulcerated
          root.
          "That should hurt you, boy."
          "Should it?" he answered.
          "Didn't you feel it?"
          "Oh, yes; I felt you were pulling my
          tooth, but it did not hurt."
          "Such a tooth ordinarily is very painful
          in being drawn," explained the doctor.
          J\ Remarkable Derr\or\stratior\ of tke
          JMystericxis Sciervce
          "For fifteen minutes, and sometimes an
          hour, alter pulling an ulcerated tooth the
          patient usually suffers greatly. It is cer
          tainly a convincing demonstration of the
          great beneficence of hypnotism in den
          tistry that this patient did not. Further
          more, I felt his pulse when he took a seat
          in the chair under the hypnotic influence
          and it was beating wildly. During the
          progress of this ordinarily painful opera-
          tion it quieted down until it became en
          tirely normaL"
          But this was not the end of the demon
          stration. The operation for the day being
          finished, the boy said, "1 would like
          to be released now; I want my sense of
          feeling."
          "Certainly," said the professor, "I will
          give you that again." But to show the
          doctors that the subject's entire body was
          without feeling he ran a needle through
          the flesh of the arm and drew it away
          without any blood following.
          "Now," he said, "you have your sense
          of feeling all except in your teeth ttat
          have been operated upon. Tney will re
          main painless until the operation is over

          Heussion of the mys-
          Htery of hypnotism
          Hran on for some time.
          I"I will show you,"
          Hsaid Professor Earley,

          I were beiore alarming
          H and distracting.
          H>'ow, my boy," said
          I the professor, ad-
          H dressing young 80l-
          Hton, "take that chair
          I over there in the cor-
          I ncr as far from me

          Bw'hen I count ten

          I sor coanted ten and
          I the boy was I asleep. He was put
          Ito convincing tests
          I that it was so.
          B "Now," said the
          Hproiessor, "when you
          Ha wake and have
          Hialked with these gen-
          Htienien in your nor-

          Hfessor snapped his
          H ringers and told him
          Htowakeup. He came
          Hto instantly, lie was
          H questioned as to how
          Ihe lelt and the con-
          Hversation became
          Hg ener al. Professor
          Earley casually drew his watch while
          the boy was looking his way, and
          the latter instantly dropped over asleep.
          The doctors present, as stated, made them
          selves certain that the demonstration was
          in all particulars just what it seemed.
          On Wednesday rooming young Boulton
          went to the office of Dr. Levkowicz
          and bad that sensitive tooth filled without
          feeling any pain, the "post hypnotic sug
          gestion," as they call it, holding good.
          All the dentists present at the clinic and
          aware of the circumstances are agreed
          that the results are nothing less than
          wonderful and that they mean a revolu
          tion in the science of dentistry.
          "It means that by a wave of the hand a
          patient having a painful operation to go
          through may be set at ease. It means
          much for both the dentist and the suffer
          ing public," said one of them.
          The Stomatological Club is a rather ex
          clusive organization and its members were
          at first blush greatly opposed to having the
          fact made public that it had lent itself to
          a countenancing of hypnotism. Dr.
          Levkowicz explained this feeling:
          "We know, as scientific men, the trend
          of the times and the necessity of keeping
          pace with them if we are to keep in the
          race at all. Dr. Bernheim's work in the
          hospitals of France is familiar to all well
          informed practitionera his success, the
          wonderful results he has attained. We
          know also the charlatanism that obtains in
          this mystic art, and we know that the pub
          lic at large, generally less well informed in
          scientific matters than the practitioner, is
          inclined to be wary of men whopraciice it.
          While we feel it our duty to investigate it
          we do not wish the impression to go
          abroad that the members of the Stomato
          logical Club are rushing into hypnotism
          as a fad. We approach the subject with
          the conservative care of a scientific propo
          sition. We feel that it would be a great
          beneficence to a patient if the pain of the
          dentist's chair might be done away with
          by a word. But, while we have had a
          number of experiments of the kind at the
          clubrooms, I am free to say that this of
          Professor Earley is the only one that has
          proved entirely convincing as to the util
          ity of hypnotism in the science of den
          tistry. All persons may not be hypno
          tized, however. Dr. Bumheim himself, I
          believe, brings under the influence only
          about 80 per cent of those he attempts.
          And, at all events, the consent of the
          patient must be obtained. As I say, with
          the Stomatological Club it is a scientific
          experiment."
          Following were the members of the club
          who were present at the clinic; Clinician,
          M. W. Levkowicz; William J. Younger,
          president of the club; Russell H. Cool,
          vice-president; S. E. Knowles, secretary;

          As for Professor J. B. Parley, who
          worked the strange influence, he is a new
          comer to the City. He is a man of slight
          figure and quiet manner, wearing the ap
          pearance of the student. His voice is low
          and kindly rather than stern and com
          manding. His eyes and the expression of
          his face are calm and reassuring. He said
          "I cannot attempt to explain the mystery of
          hypnotism any more than Edison will try
          to tell you what electricity is," he said.

          hypnotism to be part and
          parcel of medical practice?
          Judging from zt'hat some of
          the doctors say, it is so useful an
          aid to medicine that zve may expect
          to see it in the near future
          packed away hi every neatly mono
          grammed black leather case that
          accompanies a frock coat.
          Judging from what others of the
          doctors say, it> is all one with
          quackery, with foolery, with fak-

          Dr. George F. Shiels.
          It is only the effort to reduce results to a scien
          tific causation that has attracted so much atten
          tion to the psychical condition of hypnosis. That
          this power should have not only a significance
          but utility is not an illogical conclusion, arid any
          Hypnotism will never take the place of
          an anesthetic. I have not taken much In
          terest in it because I do no»think It is of
          any' benefit' In therapeutics, except In
          cases of nervousness or hysteria. The
          immense amount of time it takes to treat
          by hypnotic influence is one thing against
          it, and its limitations are another.
          Dr. J. "W. Thorn.
          Hypnotism exists and has always done
          bo. It is coeval with man and the evolu
          tion of the higher animal forms, as l\ is
          rot either in its presence or phenomena
          eciely confined to the former. The weird
          influence of the Hindoo fakir o\'er the
          eerpent of the field, or in turn, the subtle
          fascination of the reptile over Its para
          lyzed prey, are in fact based upon the
          same principle as the experiments of a
          Paracelsus or a Charcot— viz., the elimina
          tion and concentration of a force or in
          fluence which pervades life, creating an
          atmosphere of reflexodism— as palpable as
          It is universal.
          ;It is! a 'very dangerous force, and I do
          net approve of its use cither by physicians
          or. any one else. When put to -legitimate
          purpose it Is not of any., great''"* benefit
          either, in medicine; or surgery.. It" could
          not possibly take the place of an-anes
          thetic, although It has been substituted
          for it in mild 'operations -where the pain
          would not, even were the .patient con

          dane phenomena they are ever IT. Would
          it not be cruel to awake them?
          The use. of hypnotism Is riot a matter of
          indifference and demands the same -pre
          cautions as would be employed in the
          therapeusis of any potent agent. It is in
          teresting to. note a certain phase of auto-
          Infection— of a consolatory- and flattering
          'character— not'infrequently found in will

          Hed"to the modification of cer-.

          Hypnotism has been success

          agent," but its field, probably
          for the reason above stated, Is
          at present limited.' If we should
          define a class of maladies, in
          which j it .has proved and will
          likely prove most valuable, we
          should say. It- will be- that of
          functional nervous diseases.' J
          f all should j probably be at

          tation rather than to lack -of

          the force or bower.
          I have used hypnotism a great deal In
          my. practice, and yet I consider Its use
          very limited, almost entirely to nervous
          and hysterlcalpatlents, and I do not think
          it' possible for it to ever take the place
          of an anesthetic because of the length of
          time it requires, and also because some
          are not susceptible to its influence.' No
          one knows what type of person is the
          most susceptible, as opposites in charac
          teristics and temperament prove both sus
          ceptible and resistant. »I have used hyp
          notism on nearly, a hundred patients, but
          it only after all supplemented In a smaller
          degree medicine. \lt cannot touch organic
          trouble, and the length of time consumed

          The salaries of lawmakers In many
          parts of Europe seem trifling, according to
          American standards. In- London, for in
          *stance, there are 150 members in the upper
          and 250 in the lower branch. The former
          get no pay at all and the latter but*$300
          a And if any session lasts lonser
          than four months they are paid at the rate
          of $2 GO a day additional. The Parliament
          of Holland. comprises 150 members in two
          -houses.. Members of the Upper House re
          ceive 54 a day and of the second body $300
          a year and mileage. Parliament of
          Holland costs $300,000 a year.
          The most scantily paid of any of the
          regularly salaried lawmakers are those
          of Austria. There are two legislative
          bodies for Aastria, one meeting in Vienna
          and -one in Budapest. The total cost is
          $SOO,000 a year. An Austrian law provides
          that the members receive 10 florins.' of J2 a
          THE most expensive Parliament la
          Europe is that of France, which
          costs $1,500,000 a year. The French
          people are very well represented.
          There are 300 Senators and 5S4 Deputies, a
          total in excess of £00. Each 'receives a sal
          ary of S1S00 a year.
          In the United States the ninety Senators
          and 3G0 Congressmen are paid $2,500,000 In
          salaries.
          The members of the British Parliament
          serve without salary. The incidental ex
          penses of this body last "year were but
          $260,000. The German Reichstag, with its
          two branches, costs the voters on an aver

          The evil that could be done with the
          aid of hypnotism Is practically unllmlte-i
          and the good eo very limited that on the
          whole it should better be frowned upon
          by all, including the medical profession.
          I have never tried to hypnotize any one,
          though I have seen something of It. It is
          not to be depended on and there Is very
          little to recommend it.
          Its use is so limited, almost entirely to
          hysterical patients, and it might assist in
          nervous trouble. It has no curative qual
          ities, and I do not think it has made much
          progress or headway.
          I do not favor hypnotism. It is a bad
          agent in the hands of unprincipled per
          sons, and I think the majority of physi
          cians in good standing disapprove of It.
          I know there are some good physicians
          ¦who favor its use, but they are the ex
          ception that prove the rule to the con
          trary.
          Hypnotism! Why, I really never tried
          it, and have not even seen much of it, so
          my opinion on It would not amount to
          anything. Of course, there Is such a
          thing, but I always feel like classing it
          with the work of mediums and clairvoy
          ants. It is so associated In my mind,
          though some physicians approve of it. I
          do not think the majority favor it. Hys
          terical patients are about the only class
          benefited by it.
          Dr. Louis Bazet
          In some of the Eastern cities of
          our own United States it is being
          used in the medical colleges Tlnd in
          the hospitals. The San Francisco
          colleges and hospitals have not as
          yet adopted 1 it, although some of
          our physicians are using it in Their
          individual work. What somt of
          tlie representative doctors think of I
          the zvhole thing is here given,

          Judging from what all of them
          say, its use, if it have any, is
          greatest in the curing of nervous
          diseases.
          In Russia a law has been passed
          making it a criminal offense to hyp
          notize or to be an accomplice, aider
          or abettor in hypnotism. Itsad
          lisability is being questioned in
          France, and the questioning may
          end with its being made illegal
          there.
          ery. It is not reputable enough- to
          be considered by any physician.
          It is, already used to a great extent in
          Germany,' but physicians are divided in
          their opinions, some disapproving strong
          ly of it. while others find it a great aid in
          the practice of medicine.
          Suggestion is a great aid, to. physicians,
          but its,, drawback is the length of time re
          quired; Some people are very slow" to
          come under Its Influence.
          It* repeated use does not weaken the
          Intellect as some suppose; on the contrary
          in the two hypnosis schools of France
          they claim It strengthens one mentally,
          f I have used hypnotism to advantage in
          my own family, curing, after a few treat
          ments, my little boy of biting his finger
          nails. Now any one who has a child with
          this habit, that sometimes clings through
          life, will realize how almost r wonderful
          euch a sudden cure Is.
          To my mind Christian Science Is nothing
          more^than mild hypnotism. The diseases
          that I they cure can always be cured by
          hypnotism'. But neither Christian Science
          nor hypnotism can cure organic trouble or
          malignant 'diseases..-* _ _
          It could not, perhaps, cure an organic
          disease, but it. would be anv assistance In
          the treatrasnt.
          Of course, anything in" excess Is bad,
          medicine of any kind or morphine, but
          hypnotism cannot possibly hurt the pa

          nervous trouble.
          It 13 surprising the number of peoplo
          who have absolutely nothing the matter
          with them and yet think that they are
          seriously sick. Nothing a physician can
          say to the contrary will disabuse their
          minds of the idea. For this class of pa
          tients hypnotism is a "very good thing;
          outside of such it is of little use. For
          genuine sickness or ailments, such as con
          stitute the great majority of every phy
          slclan's practice. It is practically useless.
          I favor hypnotism to,sqme extent, .but
          Its 'reach is so limited that It really
          amounts to little or nothing In therapeu
          tics. It can never take the place of an
          anesthetic. It is good In imaginary dis
          eases, and may assist in functional trou
          bles, L~ut could never be of the slightest
          use in organic diseases.
          less dpos some good In cases of morphine
          and alcoholic habit, but with few great
          exceptions its benefits are only temporary,
          and as any one with ordinary intellect and
          perseverance can learn to hypnotize there
          is practically no way of controlling Its
          use. The charlatan can use it as well as
          theohyslclan.
          It Is a terrible thing to subject children
          to treatment* under hypnotic influence or
          "suggestion" either for their ailmenta or
          behavior. Each one of us Is endowed with
          a free will, and we 'are responsible for our
          own actions, and I do not believe any one
          should take the Individuality from an
          other.
          I approve of it neither In science nor
          as a parlor pastime.
          not think u can re£ch such, but in func
          tional complaints and nervousness I have,
          had very good results.
          In my own opinion It cannot hurt tha
          patient mentally or physically and is per
          manent In Its good results.
          I had one case a little boy— whose
          mother wa3 heartbroken that her son
          should be a thief and a liar. This boy was
          hypnotized and I commenced treatment,
          which after a few repetitions resulted in
          the reformation of this child with crim
          inal tendencies. JHls Improvement was no
          ticeable at -er one treatment, and after
          five or six he was a changed boy, obedi
          ent, honest and considerate. Imagine his
          mother's satisfaction at this metamorpho
          sis!
          MAGAznvff -SECTION
          It is claimed the British army surgeons
          In India have used It In amputations, but
          those are the only operations of that na
          ture reported. For the few good things
          It can be used there are many bad ones,
          and the evil far outweighs the good.
          It is certainly very Interesting as a
          psychological phenomenon. .1 have even
          seen Charcot, the celebrated hypnotist of
          Paris, make patients change (or apparent
          ly do so) complaints. But I object strong
          ly to the subservience of a person's in
          dividuality, even though it is for that per
          son's immediate Dhyslcal benefit. It doubt-
          There are so few things in which It can
          be used with efficacy. I really care very
          little for it, and outside of hysterical pa
          tients do not think It will ever be used
          by physicians to any extent.
          Dr. Beatrice M. Hinckle.
          I consider hypnotism of great benefit
          and have used it frequently. I use It
          wherever practicable In nervous and func
          tional trouble, but have also found It of
          great assistance In ac
          couchement cases. 1 have
          never treated a patient for
          the morphine habit except
          tonce, a woman at the Jail
          who was suffering torture,
          and she was soon quieted
          by the hanmotle treatment.

          notize patients quite read
          ily, usually In a few min
          utes, although some require
          I considerable time and pa

          in organic trouble, for I do

          PROMINENT PHYSiGIANS'S QUEER
          DELUSION; HYPNOTIZES HIMSELF
          NEW YORK, May 13.—At his own re
          quest Dr. Paul H. Collins, of 408 Central
          Park Wept, is now undergoing treatment
          at Bellevue hospital tor the strangest
          malady, or whatever it might be called,
          ill.l the physician.* at that institution
          have ever had to (leal with.
          He believes that he can hypnotise him
          self.
          For long be hag delved into the im-!«iie.«
          of hypnotism, and it in believed that bis
          mind has become so imbued with the sub
          ject M to result in a moat singular im
          pairment.
          On other subjects the unfortunate physi
          cian it perfectly rational. Physically his
          condition in good. He seem* to realise
          that his self-hypnosis is a weird delusion,
          a nightmare of a disordered mind, but try
          as he will, so far he has been utterly un i
          able to rid himself of it.
          For a year it has haunted him night and
          day. "The end can only be death," he
          repeats pathetically. And Dr. Collins I
          dreads the very name of death, and, no j
          wonder, for he firmly believes that it will
          come to him in a ghastly manner.
          "I will gome day hypnotize myself." li« i
          tells the hospital physicians, "into a state
          of coma, and then be buried alive.'' This
          dread thought is with him ever.
          Dr. Parker, head of the psychopathic
          ward, is unable to state what will be the
          ultimate result of this strange case. The
          alienist does not believe self-hypnosis pos
          sible.
          To your correspondent he said: "There
          is do authenticated record of inch a thing.
          It i- ,c remarkable delusion, more remark
          able in the Fact that on oilier subject*
          Dr. Collins can converse sanely, even bril
          liantly. As for hit- intense fear of death
          any one would have that who carried con
          stantly with him the braln-rnking idea
          that his certain fate- was to "be buried
          alive."
          Other members of the medical profession
          ■who have known Dr. Collins in the past,
          state that he has been a great student, lias
          ample funds, and is of a liberal mind and
          generous disposition. He is a big man,
          aged somewhere in the titties, and has
          never married. His mother lives in the
          northern part of New York state. His
          brother is in Buffalo.
          When Dr. Collins went to the hospital
          he astonished Dr. Parker by exclaiming:
          "I am .1 doctor, like yourself, and I want
          you to thoroughly examine me and tell me
          whether I am going crazy."
          "What seems to be the trouble?" asked
          Dr. Parker.
          And then came the story that reminds
          one sonic of Jekyl and Hyde. Dr. Collins
          told how he had studied deeply into he
          art of hypnotism anil had attained remark
          able success in its practice. He went on:
          '•Finally came the time when I discov
          ered that I could sit alone and hypnotize
          myself. The sensation is indescribable
          "and decidedly uncomfortable, and 1 realize

          Hypnosis Is Aid To Doctors
          By ALTON BLAKESLEE
          Associated Press Science Writer

          The odds are good, and grow*:
          ing, that your doctor will suggest
          hypnotizing you as part of your I
          medical treatment, or to aid in
          surgery or childbirth.
          Before you rear back in dismay, j
          or start calling him a stagestruck
          charlatan, consider current medi-(
          cal facts and viewpoints on hyp
          nosis.
          Today at least 7,000 U.S. physi
          cians and as many dentists are
          actively using hypnosis, and many
          are taking courses to learn how.(
          Medical journals and speakers
          increasingly report benefits from
          hypnosis to kill pain in hopeless
          cancer, or pain after surgery, as
          an aid to breaking some bad
          habits, or in losing weight, or in
          having babies with less or some
          times no anesthesia.
          They also warn it’s no panacea,
          that it has limitations and even
          hazards if used unwisely.
          Two years ago the American
          Medical Assn, approved hypnosis
          as an acceptable type of medical
          treatment.
          Hypnosis dates way back to ear
          ly human times, and bears some
          taint of theatrical magic since it's
          often used to provide mystifying
          and entertaining stage shows.
          Nor is hypnosis news in medi
          cine. It has waxed and waned be-'
          fore in popularity. But in this lat-j
          est revival, hypnosis is being
          studied scientifically, to pin down
          benefits and limitation*, and this
          time it bids to stay.
          Based on medical literature and
          interviews, here are some ques
          tions and answers concerning hyp-(
          nosis in medicine:
          Q: Exactly what is hypnosis’
          A: There is no satisfactory def-'
          inition yet, any more than there
          are real definitions of sleep or
          consciousness, says Dr. Lewis R.
          jWolberg, New York psychiatrist,
          who has employed hypnosis as
          one technique of therapy for 20
          years. Hypnosis lies somewhere
          between sleep and wakefulness,

          and all of us are normally sug
          gestible.
          Q:. What happens in hypnosis?
          A: You simply accept and act
          on the suggestions given you—to
          irelax, to feel sleepy, to feel no
          [pain, or carry out some suggestion
          (after the trance, even long after
          ward.
          Q: How does it feel to be hyp
          [notized?
          A: You don't sleep. In fact,
          your senses are all more acute
          [than normally. Many people come
          out of a trance certain they had
          not been hypnotized at all. The
          [trance makes you feel pleasant
          ly relaxed.
          Q: Do jou lose your will pow-j
          [er; or “fall under the spell” of
          the hypnotist?
          A: No, you can actually wake
          yourself at any time you want.
          Q: Can everyone by hypnotized?
          A: No. Experts estimate 80 to
          90 per cent of us can be induced
          into a light trance, about half of
          ■us into a middle stage, and only
          [about 20 per cent into a deep or
          (somnambulistic trance, resem
          bling deep sleep.
          i Q: Will people commit immoral'
          or criminal acts under hj’pnosis?!
          A: They awaken before doing
          anything they ordinarily would not!
          ;do. In 25 years, only three docu-(
          imented cases of actual criminal!
          .acts involving hypnotic suggestion'
          [have been reported, says Dr. Mar
          tin T. Orne of Harvard Medical
          School.
          Q: Can hypnosis make child
          (birth completely painless?
          A: Only for some few women.
          ■But many others can be helped
          [to relax, to reduce fears and ten
          sions, and need less anesthesia.
          Q: Can hypnosis really banish
          .the pain of cancer?
          A: Perhaps half of cancer pa
          tients can get some relief or con
          trol of pain, and 10 per cent may
          need no pain-killing drugs at all.
          The pain is still there, but hyp
          nosis permits them to block out
          the perception of pain.
          Q: Can it help somedne quit
          smoking?
          A: Again yes, sometimes. But
          much depends upon his real de
          sire to stop, and his reasons for
          excessive smoking. One woman
          quit, through hypnosis, but then
          i began eating too much and gained
          140 pounds. Hypnotized again, she
          stopped gorging, but became an
          alcoholic. She needed ’psychother
          apy to gain insight into her fun
          jdamental problems and tensions.
          Just taking away one crutch led
          to substituting another.

          WHEELING
          The road ahead is smooth and
          straight. The sky is clear; the
          pavement dry. Your car is fairly
          new and powerful—so smooth it
          seem to drive itself. It’s around
          noontime and you roll along the
          trouble-free highway at 50 or 60
          miles an hour.
          Suddenly, you run into the rear
          end of a truck.
          What happened
          Even if you survive you’ll prob
          ably never know. Perhaps they’ll
          say you fell asleep at the wheel.
          But you were wide awake and rest
          ed. Maybe they’ll say you were
          driving too fast. But you were go
          ing only 50 or so, legal in North
          Carolina. So maybe you were fol
          lowing the truck too closely. But
          you never even saw a truck. The
          road ahead was clear; you’re sure
          of that.
          If you weren’t driving and drink
          ing and nothing went wrong with
          your car, no one can say for sure
          what made you hit the truck.
          But psyschologists and some
          traffic authorities have what they
          think might be the answer. It’s
          called “highway hypnosis.”
          State troopers have investigated
          thousands of accidents easily as
          signable to highway hypnosis, al
          though no one had defined the
          term nor, for that matter, even
          invented it.
          Yet no hypnotist could ask for
          better conditions—complete atten
          tion of the driver to the unbroken
          ribbon of road in front of him.
          So the accidents go into the re
          cords probably as speeding, follow
          ing* too closely, or falling asleep at
          the wheel.
          Traffic experts are particularly
          concerned about these mishaps be
          cause they are usually severe and
          very often fatal. Occuring on rela
          tively high speed roadways with
          excellent driving conditions and
          few of the usual traffic hazards to
          slow you down and make you drive
          a little more carefully, the high
          way hypnosis accident happens
          when you’re hitting 50 mph or
          more.
          If highway hypnosis proves in
          deed an important cause of acci
          dents, it will become even more so
          as the nation gradually adds to and
          completes the 41,000 mile Inter
          state system.
          One authority has suggested that
          drivers will have to be “stimulat
          ed and excited to the point that
          the laws of self preservation will
          work.” What he means is that
          modern highways have eliminated
          many of the distractions that for
          merly kept drivers alert. H» points
          out that by denuding highways of
          such distractions (signs, lights,
          etc.) on the theory that it’s easier
          for the motorist to concentrate on
          his driving, it actually creates a
          new and far more dangerous haz
          ard from the standpoint of safety.
          "The ideas of highway engineers
          keeping our highways somewhat
          away from civilization by screen
          ing from view' most of the pro
          ducts of man—those things which
          are of fundamental interest to hu
          man beings—is not sound,” says
          the authority.
          That’s controversial, to be sure.
          Still many other experts agree the
          evidence is good that signs and
          »y»er roadside objects serve as
          stimulants to drivers.
          Essentially though, prevention of
          highway hypnosis falls into two
          distinct classes features that
          engineers can build into roads and
          things you can do yourself to avoid
          being overcome by monotony.
          In the latter case, several effec
          tive ways have been suggested.
          Among them are:
          Stop frequently on a long trip
          and get out of the car for a walk
          around. Drink a cup of coffee or
          tea and relax a few minutes.
          If you’re traveling alone, lower
          the windows to create a breeze in
          the car. Even in winter, too much
          heat can lull you into danger.
          Munch candy or chew a big wad
          of gum while you’re driving. Some
          drivers sing as they go.
          Vary your speed every 15 min
          utes or so on long trips. Driving
          at a steady speed is one of the
          commonest causes of the drowsi
          ness that’s a warning signal of
          highway hypnosis.
          Avoid heavy meals and overeat
          ing just before long trips. And
          stay away from fried, starchy
          foods.
          Maintain a good erect posture
          while at the wheel. That comfort-

          HYPNOSIS MACHINE.
          Devices to Produee the Mesmerie
          State Mechanically.
          WHIRLING MIRRORS AND CRY
          STALS ARE USED.
          Influence of Certain Chemicals Upon Sensi
          tive Subjects—Uses of the Power Which
          Would lie Very Marvellous.
          Even hypnosis may now be produced by
          machinery. We are approaching a day
          when the direct influence of Svengalies will
          not be necessary to throw Trilbies into sub
          jective states, when hypnotists will exert
          their powers through machinery set to oper
          ate at given times, the presence of the in
          struments being unknown to the subjects.
          The mechanical mesmerizer will then find
          an essential place in the burlgar’s tool kit,
          and we will have to look under our beds to
          see if such traps have been set by our ene
          mies. The mechanical hypnotizer as now
          made, however, is strictly a scientific in
          strument. The government’s bureau of edu
          cation recently purchased a collection of
          such apparatus, which aie new in this
          country. They will be used by a specialist
          for studiyng the values of hypnotic sugges
          tion m the education of the abnormal
          classes. Experiments will be made deter
          mining their effect upon the sensibilities,
          emotions, breathing, circulation and tem
          perature of the body.
          AN ELABORATE APPARATUS.
          The most elaborate form'of hypnotizer is a
          small box, containing clock work,surmount
          ed by two li izontal oblonjj fans, one over
          the other, revolving rapidly in opposite di
          rections. The fans are studded on each side
          with a row of circular mirrors, about the
          size of nickel pieces. The rapid rotation
          produces an odd flashing effect which great
          ly fatigues the eyelid muscles of the be
          holder, This machine is found to be very
          effective when used upon sensitives
          who can be thrown into a hypnotic sleep
          by concentration or sight stimulus.
          A simpler form of mechanical hypnotizer
          is a belt of broad tape to be placed upon the
          forehead and over the temples, being tied
          at the back of the head. From a metallic
          plate in front protrudes a wire, extending
          upward in an S-like curve and holding a
          bright ball of nickel, about the size of a
          marble,'at the end. When this is placed
          upon the subject the wire is bent until the
          ball reaches a point above the eye, where
          it may be seen by the wearer only by in
          trni Cf*l V Ctv’l lm'n cr tlin m-alirla Tlio Duma
          effect, as produced by the former machine
          is accomplished by this simpler apparatus.
          These instruments have been invented to
          serve in substitution for.thejgestures, known
          as passes, commonly made by hypnotists.
          The scientific hypnotist makes movements
          before and above the eyes of his subject to
          concentrate his attention and to fatigue the
          eyelid muscles both by causing the eyes to
          follow thejmovements and by. fanning air
          against them. Fatigue of the muscles of the
          eyelids is found to he one of the direct
          causes of sleep. Persons in no mental need
          of sleep may “read themselves sleepy” fun
          der a too bright or a tod dim light. A se
          vere breeze against the eyelids will cause
          the same effect.
          MAGNETIC INFLUENCES.
          Another form of hypnotizer, in this collec
          tion, is a large horsehoe magnet with an at
          tached armature. It is given to a sensitive
          who is told to continuously separate and
          fit together the twx> parts. A similar mag
          netic hypnotizer is a steel ring to lit 'the in
          dex finger. The ring is of magnetized steel
          and is borken at one place, the space being
          filled by a small steel armature. These two
          contrivances are used principally for humor
          ing the more unsoj)histicated,and superstiti
          ous sensitives who foster the belief that.hyp
          notism is supernatural. The magnet in
          most cases suggests mystery to the ignorant
          and sensitives of that class are readily ex
          cited by it. The ring device, also called a
          hypnoscope, is used by some hypnotists for
          determining sensitives. Hypnotizable per
          sons are alleged to experience certain thig
          lings in the skin and twitchings of the mus
          cles while wearing it. A more complicated
          instrument in this collection, which may
          be used as a hypnoscope, is a bulb-shaped
          *od, resembling an electrode, which may
          be made to create pressure against the palm
          of the hand by a sprig inside. When the
          pressure is applied the subject is asked if he
          feels an electric shock. If he so confesses
          he is, rated as a hypnotic sensitive. Some
          times the whole frame will tremble as a re
          sult of this imaginary electrical fluid.
          CRYSTAL VISIONS.
          Equally interesting devices of a related
          class, now growing, in vogue'among certain
          experimental hypnotists, are for application
          to sensitives for the purpose of causing hal
          lucinations known as crystal visions. One
          instrument of this class is a ball of crystal
          mounted upon a handle. Mirrors and other
          polished or trasparent surfaces are employed
          for the same effect. The crystal or reflect
          ing medium by producing i>artly obscured
          q£ scattered reflections to the sensitive
          mind’s eye aid the subject in perceiving un
          natural mental embodiments of various ob
          jects. Many abnormal persons, habitually
          haunted by phantasms, for which visions
          they develop appetites, so to speak, employ
          these crystals and reflectors for throwing
          themselves into states during which they
          may experience what is alleged to be the
          actual or imagined “sixth sense” or “sec
          ond sight.” Crystal gazing has lately be
          come so popular that many phsychic experi
          mentalists in Europe are inviting tests •with
          the paraphernalia thus employed,and agents
          were some time since engaged by theSociety
          for Psychical Research to furnish balls for
          the purpose. Prof. Wm. Romaine New bold
          of the University of Pennsylavnia recently
          made an extensive investigation of crystal
          vision and found that twenty-tvo subjects
          out of eiglity-six could perceive illusions by
          gazing into mirrors, surfaces of water and
          objects of glass varying in form. Phantasms
          appeared to the sensitives usually within
          fly© minutes, being preceded directly by
          cloud;ness, hazes of color or illuminations
          before the eyes. The phantasms varied from
          dim outlines to brilliant colored pictures.
          Like dreams some of these forms were based
          upon recent experiences of the subjects,
          while others were purely fantastic.
          AN EXPERIMENT.
          A simple experiment in this line may be
          tried at home by any one who will sit be
          fore an open window, at twilight, keeping
          liis gaze fixed preferably upon some land
          scape, distant rovr of houses or collection oi
          conspicious clouds. If the temptation to
          wink the eyelids can be resisted until they
          become greatly fatigued, so as to remain
          open only at a great strain, the natural im
          ages will gradually grow more and more
          indistinct, and will apparently arrange
          themselves into fantastic groups or fade
          into rapidly changing forms. The abnormal
          imagination of a person subject to light
          hallucinations would readily discern weird
          phantoms in such a picture.
          Drugs, such as uiethane, snlphol, a par
          aldehyde, etc., are now used successfully
          to produce a sleep which to all appearances
          is hypnotio. Some foreign hypnotists use
          ether and chloroform to induce hypnosis.
          Recent experiments indicate that there is
          a great similarity between hypnosis and the
          action of hasheesh, as well as the newly
          tested mescal, which is used by certain of
          our western Indians to produce trances.
          Phenomena very similar to hypnosis is now
          noticed also during thhe ordinary sleep pro
          duced by simple anaesthetics, and the ques
          tion is being asked, Do anaesthetics produce
          hypnosis? A member of the Royal Chemical
          Society of London recently demonstrated
          that man possesses two distinct conscious
          nesses. He says that persons under the hi
          fi uenee of anaesthetics, while not conscious
          of what is happening at the time of the oper
          ation, are sometimes able, several days
          after, to describe in detail what was hap
          pening to them. What he calls he “worka
          day consciousness” was absent at the time
          but the“ subliminal consciousness,” he says,
          was present during the operation. Hence
          anaesthetics destroy the former and only
          postpone the enregistering of the sensation
          conductors controlling the latter conscious
          ness. It may be that this “subliminal con
          sciousness”^ the one affected by hypnotists.
          SENSITIVE TO DRUGS.
          Recent labratory experiments have also
          been made to ascertain the effects of drugs
          upon persons in a hypnotic state. Some sub
          jects are found to be so sensitive to drugs
          while in this condidtion that they contort
          themselves in various ways when the sub
          stances are not applied directly, but merely
          held in proximity of their skin, not even
          touching it. Some chemical substances,
          even when sealed in tubes, will cause sensi
          tives to alter their bodily appearances and
          physical co ditions, producing violent con
          vulsions, hallucinaitons, alternations of the
          pupils, changes in the pulse-beats,symptoms
          of joy, grief or anger and other emotional
          conditions.
          The influence of color upon hypnotized
          persons has also been tested in the labora
          tory by subjecting sensitives to rays of light
          passing through various screens of different
          colored glass. Blue light is found to produce
          sadness, red light joy, yellow light strong
          affection and violet or green light variable
          conditions. Charcot used a sudden ray of
          intense light as one means of throwing sen
          sitives into the hypnotio state.
          Justus these instruments for producing
          hypnosis are applied to the sense of sight,
          other physical methods are applied, in its
          Induction, to the senses of hearing and
          touch. The conditions does not seem to be

          into hypnotic states by the sharp and sud
          len sounding of a large gong. The ticking
          :f a watch has been used with the same
          success by others, the sensitive being re
          quired to concentrate his mind upon the
          sound, just as he does upon the seeing of the
          revolving fans or nickel ball. The monoto
          nous chants sung by semi-civilized nations
          are f ound to produce the same effect.
          STROKES AND PASSES.
          For creating hypnosis through the sense of
          touch, strokings or pressure upon the skin
          are resorted to by some hypnotists, while
          others apply warm plates of metal to differ
          ent parts of the body. Physicians realize
          that warmth induces natural sleep, while
          colaness tends to prevent it. Some foreign
          hypnotists maintain that the crown of the
          head, roof of.the nose, the thumb or, elbow
          are most sensitive to hypnotic stimulation
          by touch. Some merely scratch the skin of
          the neck or touch the forehead. The elec
          tric battery as been resorted to by a few ex
          perimenters, who claim that it is success!ul
          as an inducing agent. It is said to cause the
          same imaginary effect as the magnet.
          It is now an easy matter for certain hyp
          notists to transform natural sleep into hyp
          notic sleep without the subject’s knowledge.
          Thus one who goes to sleep in a public place
          may never remember what foolish actions
          he has been made to do during that period.
          Hypnotic suggestion is the latest phase of
          this whole subject which is now interesting
          expeirmenters. A sensitive, under hypnotic
          influence, receives a command from the
          hypnotist which he will obey on awaken
          ing, although he is unconcious of ever hav
          ing received such a command. This power
          is used by a physician in Massachusetts,
          who is said to be able to stop the most se
          vere pain by suggestion. Several people re
          port to the Society for Psychical Research
          that he has given the suggestions before
          thev have crone to the dentist. With the
          result that their dentistry has Invariably
          been painless. Experiments are now being
          made as to the value of hypnotic suggestion
          in education. Its medical value has already
          been proven in France, where such condi
          tions as nervous insomnia, sonambulism,
          kleptomania, laziness and various forms of
          moral degeneracy have been cured by its
          means.
          USES OF HYPNOSIS.
          The power of suggestion as an agent in
          crime is now being talked about in this
          country. Men are believed to have been
          hanged for committing murder while acting
          under hypnotic influence from another.
          Some celebrated medico-legalists have pro
          posed that laws should be passed defining
          the responsible murderers in such cases. In
          such an event hypnotism will be as bother
          some a plea of defense as insanity is today.
          The dangers threatened by the vicious or
          careless hypnotist have become legally real
          ized In France and Russia. In the former
          hypnotism is forbidden for purposes of pub
          lic amusement, and in the latter no persons
          except licensed physicians can practice it.
          It is said that 80 per cent of the people in
          the world are hypnotizable. The hypnotists,
          on the other hand, are discovering and im
          proving their powers faster and faster each
          day. Will they at some future century be
          come^the governing classes of the earth,
          and will the great host of sen sitives become
          their slaves? Perhaps that is somewhat the
          case now. Trustworthy authorities relate
          hypnotism with the same power oy which
          the teacher impresses his students, the
          preacher converts his congregation, the
          pleader convinces the jury, or by which the
          orator holds his audience with bated breath,
          receiving cheers at every nod, although
          heard and understood by few. According
          to this, Mr. Bry&n is a hypnotist, and doubt
          less Mr. McKinley is one.

          BASIS OF HYPNOTISM.
          Hypnotic Suggestion in Determining
          Criminal Responsibility.
          Learned Authorities Declare That a
          Criminal Hypnotist Can Influ
          ence a Criminal.
          To the human mind there is a won
          derful fascination in the study of the
          problems of hypnotism. We see with
          the same and even more interest the
          phenomena of the hypnotic trance now
          than we did in the earlier experiments
          of the middle and later years of our
          century.
          The fermentation of popular thought
          regarding it has kept in advance of
          scientific conclusion for the past fifty
          years and has been nearer right than
          the scientists as a rule. The vacilla
          tion of the French Academy regarding
          the truth of hypnosis under another
          name was as remarkable as the ver
          satility of the French Academy of Med
          icine, which now accepts the hypnotic
          trance as an established scientific fact,
          end the therapeutic value of hypnosis
          on the continent of Europe is hardly
          questioned in the more advanced cir
          cles at all.
          That such is perhaps not the fact as
          to medical opinion this side of the At
          lantic* is due to a variety of causes.
          Among these I will notice two that
          have brought hypnotism into dispute
          among us.
          First, the traveling hypnotists, who
          have made exhibitions and have as a
          rule and with scarcely an exception
          been frauds, hiring and using their
          trained subjects from purely mercenary
          motives, and when exposed have, of
          course, brought discredit upon the
          whole subject among the better classes
          of our people.
          Second, the medical profession have
          as a rule substantially rejected or ig
          nored hypnosis in their practice. Few
          of the abler men who know of its great
          value in therapeutics go so far as to
          Use it with their patients.
          How many medical men in this city
          practice hypnotism?
          They would nearly all vote for a law
          that no one but a medical man should
          be owed to use it. without reflect
          ing that to execute such a law in New
          York would practically be to abolish
          hypnotism almost absolutely.
          A keen medical observer tells me that
          rot one physician in a thousand in New
          York practices hypnotic suggestion, but
          he is wrong. Many do it privately who
          have not the courage to publicly an
          nounce it.
          The public have, as they suppose,
          the* right to ask medical men to exam
          ine and pass upon this question for
          them, but they have looked in vain for
          light from this source.
          HYPNOSIS IN AM ERICA.
          Carl S. xtus gives me his views on
          lh;s subject as follows:
          There are two elements in American
          •octafl life antagonistic to the recogni
          tion of hypnosis.
          First and foremost I place the medi
          cal profession. As a rule physicians
          Very rarely and except in isolated in
          stances know anything whatever about
          the subject. They have never studied
          It. They have never taken the necessary
          preliminary steps to know how to hyp
          notise any one. As a general rule 85
          I er beat, of the medical profession have
          never hypnotized a subject. So far as
          my experience and observation among
          medical men are concerned on this side
          of the Atlantic, th -se who knolv least
          of the subject are the ones who usually
          denounce it most.
          For example. I read in a New York
          paper in an account of the proceedings
          before the Psychological Section of the
          Medico-Legal Society criticisms by Dr.
          H. W. Mitchell and Dr. Bettini di Moise
          Assuming that the subjects of Dr.
          Simon and Dr. Wines were shamming.
          Which is substantially a denial of the
          existence of the true hypnotic trance,
          1 learn on inquiry that while those sub
          jects were examined by a committee of
          at least five physicians who were pres
          ent, Dr. H. W. Mitchell declined to make
          any examination.
          "Of hat value is his opinion as to
          their condition as against the five medi
          cal gentlemen who did examine?
          "T venture to assert that neither Dr.
          Di Moise nor Dr. Mitchell ever hypno
          tised a subject in his life, and that while
          they might not have the courage to deny
          the therapeutic value of hypnosis in a
          large ilass of mental and nervous dis
          turbances, or its value in surgical trea*.
          ment, because it is now everywhere
          practised by surgeons of position, still
          they would, if closely questioned, prob
          ably confess that they did not believe in
          the existence of the hypnotic trance.
          "These observations could not be just
          ly applied to the medical profession
          abroad. Medical men of the highest
          character and standing throughout Con
          tinental Europe recognize and acknow
          ledge not only the existence of true hyp
          nosis, but its great therapeutic and sui
          The e>ther class b the general public,
          who have been so much Imposed upon
          by charlatans a. d traveling fakirs and
          misled oy the absolute ignorance of their
          medical advisers that they have been
          ■ed to distrust the whole subject. Hyp
          notic science in America thus rents
          trader the shadow cast upon it by th"
          ignorance of a profession whose duty
          it is clearly to examine and practice it.
          and who have not hesitated in neglect
          ing this, their plain duty, to throw their
          influence against recognized scientific
          truth."
          STUDY OF HYPNOSIS.
          The psychological section of the Med
          ico-Legal Society decided to take up this
          BtQdj as OM of the legitimate and im
          portant subjects of inquiry. The aims
          and objects of that set tion have been
          stated at the last Medico-Legal Con
          gross as follows:
          "The domain of investigation which

          "The section is interested in all which
          pertains to the wide domain of psy
          chology; in the rapidly growing facui
          ties which the colleges and universities
          are offering to students in experimental
          work, as well as in that vast region of
          psychological phenomena, which, with
          its perplexing and increasing complica
          tions, demands the strictest and most
          scientific investigation.
          "It is intended to embrace special
          study in the departments of animal
          magnetism, telepathy and clairvoyance,
          and also of the so-called apparitions and
          other claims of respectable modern
          spiritualism.
          "It is proposed to conduct these in
          quiries and investigations with candor
          and fairness, upon strictly scientific
          lines, and to reach, so far as possible, a
          valuable and enlightening collection of
          facts incident to these phenomena,
          from which important deductions may
          be made."
          The position of the Medico-Legal So
          ciety as to this subject was taken in
          January, 1891, upon the report of its
          Standing Committee on Hypnotism,
          from which I submit the following ab
          stracts:—
          "Hypnosis, or artificial trance sleep,
          is a subjective phenomenon.
          "Hypnosis is recognized in three
          stages—lethargy, somnambulism and
          catalepsy.
          "Hypnotism has been serviceable in
          medical and surgical practice, both as
          a therapeutic agent and in some eases
          as an efficient and safe anaesthetic.
          "The illusory impression created by
          hypnosis may be made to terminate
          and tyrannise the subsequent actions of
          the subject.
          "And among the legal questions raised
          by this report were:—ls hypnosis a jus
          tifiable inquisitorial agent? Do we
          need a reconstruction of the laws of
          evidence in view of the perversion,
          visual or otherwise, created by the
          trance? Is any revision of the Penal
          <'ode desirable in view of these facts?"
          The most pertinent, and. indeed, im
          portant question whii h is now upper
          most in the judicial and legal mind, as
          well as among laymen, is. What is the
          true relation Of hypnotism to crime?
          This is a Question that we cannot ig
          nore. It must be met. We cannot
          pass it by on the other side. Like
          BanqUO'S ghost, it will not down.
          The trial and conviction of Czinski in
          Munich, in December, 1884, only two
          years ago. was the first judicial decis
          ion and conviction of a man for a
          crime based on the recognition of the
          actuality of the hypnotic trance. The
          Bompard case, in Parts, did not estab
          lish that judicially. The case of Mac-
          Donald in Kansas, did not turn at all
          on hypnotism, as the public press has
          sometimes asserted.
          We may all have our individual opin
          ions as to the responsibility of the
          hypnotised, but as so few of us have
          given especial study to the practical
          side of hypnotism, the opinions of those
          who have given these subjects especial
          study will be more valuable to us all
          than OUT own conclusions not based
          upon careful and expe imental trials.
          With this in view, 1 lately addressed
          1. If the subject is unconscious and
          even unwilling, l as the hypnotizer such
          power and domination over the hypno
          Used as could control action to the
          extent of the commission of a crime?
          Is it certain or possible to remove
          by hypnotic suggestion from the mind
          |of the subject all the memory or oc
          currences which happen in the hyp
          notic state?
          3. Would it be possible for a hypno
          j tizer to so control a hypnotised subject
          as to, for example, make him (1) sign
          a will in the presence of third persons,
          declare it to be his will, £nd to re
          quest them to sign as attesting wit
          nesses, and he afterward wholly uncon
          scious of the occurrence; (2) or a note
          of hand, or a check?
          Professor G. Stanley Hall replied:
          I would say that my own experience
          with hypnotism, which was quite ex
          tended while I was at the Johns Hop
          kins, leaves no shadow of doubt that a
          hypnotic subject can be made an un
          conscious and innocent agent of crime.
          Signing away of money has been done
          in France, and rapes have been com
          mitted. The Penal Code has been mod
          ified in important respects to meet such
          cases. All memory is sometimes re
          moved from the subject mind, but not
          always."
          Professor J. Mark Baldwin of Prince
          ton University, one of the editors of
          the "Psychological Review," says. In
          response to the questions; To the first
          tirst question, "Yes. I think so; the par
          ticular crime depending upon the men
          tal and moral habits of the subject;
          each subject's suggestibility for crime
          seems to have its limits, at which he
          resists and refuses the suggestion."
          To the second question he replies:
          "Not generally, although the subject
          may hesitate and make an apparent
          effort to resist, and then finally follow
          out the suggestion."
          To the third question he replies:
          EFFECTS ON THE SUBJECT.
          "Yes, indeed, such forgetfulness, after
          the subject returns to his normal state,
          is the regular phenomenon, not re
          quiring any special suggestion." He
          adds. The word certain' In the ques
          tion is slisrhtly ambiguous."
          To the fourth question, as to both its
          first and second subdivisions, he re
          plies:
          Yes, to each."
          George Frederick Laid!aw, If. D.,
          New York, replied:
          "1. Crime can be committed by the
          hypnotizer, the subject being the un
          conscious and innocent agent and in
          strument.
          "2, The operator usually can control
          the subject in conscious state only by
          a previous hypnotic sleep, in which
          suggestions were given to be carried
          out when the subject became conscious.
          The subject rarely or never remem
          bers what has passed during the hyp
          notic trance. He will certainly forget
          the occurrence if ordered to do so.
          "4. If the operator had the subject
          in a hypnotic state he could compel the
          Signing cf papers, which act would be

          proclivities well marked, could be. be
          cause: 1. A person cannot be hypno
          tized against his will. 2. A person so
          hypnotized is not absolutely and in all
          things under the domination of the will
          of the hypnotist.
          "These two statements accepted, I
          think throws hypnotism out of criminal
          jurisprudence."
          Thompson Jay Hudson, while con
          ceding that persons in a hypnotic state
          are constantly amenable to control by
          suggestion, denies that hypnotism has
          any place in crime.
          James R. Cocks. M. D., in his recent
          work says that he does not believe that
          the average individual in the hypnotic
          state could be made to commit crime.
          In a discussion on this subject in the
          Medico-Legal Congress Dr. Wiliam Lee
          Howard of Baltimore, in speaking of
          the experiments he had made in Bal
          timore, says he has repeatedly at
          tempted to induce subjects to make fe
          lonious attacks on persons under the
          most aggravating circumstances with
          out securing the least indication of
          obedience. He says further:
          CRIMINAL SUGGESTION DIFFI
          CULT.
          "For instance, while my subjects
          would stab right and left with paper
          daggers, yet when a real dagger was
          placed within their hands they have in
          variably refused to use it. I account for
          this cm the ground that a person in the
          active hypnotic state possesses a dual
          existence, and is perfectly conscious of
          what he is doing, in most cases he will
          carry out the expressed wish of the
          operator, provided it does not affront
          his sense of propriety or seriously cross
          his ideas of right and wrong.
          "For several years I have made use
          of hypnotism in surgical practice, and
          my experience in this direction leads me
          to the conclusion that hypnosis is a men
          tal state rather than a physical condi
          tion —such, for instance, as ether an 1
          chloroform narcosis. Time and again
          have I had patients, who responded to
          all the tests of hypnotic anaesthetsia
          before the operation, when called upon
          to face tiie actual ordeal come out of
          the hypnotic state, the fear of the opera
          tion being a stronger suggestion than
          that of the operator, consequently the
          subject awakened, obedient to the law of
          self-preservation, which is never set
          aside, even in the profoundest hypnotic
          state.
          "In conclusion, let me reiterate mv
          basal proposition, (liven a criminal or
          immoral subject and a hypnotist of 'ike
          Character, and criminal or immoral re
          sults may be obtained."
          Dr. t r O. B. Winsrate, late Health
          Commissioner of Milwaukee, Wis., and
          Viee-Chnlrmah Section on Psychology
          Medico-Legal Society, in a valuable
          paper read before the International
          Medico-Legal Congress at Chicago, Au
          gust, 1883, entitled "Suggestion Not
          Hypnotic and Crime," summarized his
          conclusions as follows:
          CRIME MAY' BE INDUCED.
          "1. There are many persons who are
          on the border line of irresponsibility.
          "2. Such persons only need certain
          forms of suggestion to cause them to
          commit criminal acts.
          Suggestions of crime are largely
          disseminated by published sensational
          accounts of criminal acts and evil do
          ings, and bjr certain pictures posted in
          1 üblic places.
          "4. Suggestion of crime is often conta
          gious among a certain number of per
          sons possessing partially unbalanced
          minds.
          "5. Organized effort can do much to
          prevent crime, by investigation and
          study of the phenomena of criminal sug
          gestion.
          Efforts should be made to suppress
          and regulate the production of the large
          amount of unhealthy suggestion now
          being disseminated, and such work is
          as important and promises as good re
          sults as the efforts being put forth to
          control contagious physical diseases."
          Dr. T. D. Crothers of Hartford, one
          of the Vice-Chairmen of the Psychologi
          cal Section, Medico-Legal Society, in at.
          article entitled "Hypnotism," says: "I
          am inclined to doubt this power to make
          a person do a criminal act, unless the
          mind is already criminal in its in
          stincts."
          On the same subject Thomson Jay
          Hudson of the Washington bar, author
          of the "Law of Psychic Phenomena,"
          and other works, has contributed a
          valuable paper upon the "Legal Status
          of Hypnotism in Medical Jurispru
          dence."
          Hudson adopts Rerheim's definition of
          hypnotism as "the induction of a pecul
          iar physical condition, which increases
          the susceptibility to suggestion," with
          one modification, viz: substituting the
          word "induces" for "increases."

          new universally received of the law of
          suggestion among scientists, with a
          few important exceptions.
          This law is stated as follows:
          "Persons in a hypnotic state are con
          stantly amenable t» control by sug
          gestion."
          Mr. Hudson combats the view of the
          Charcot school, who claim that hypno
          tism can only be induced in hysterical
          persons, and adopts the contrary view",
          which is fast becoming universal among
          those who have investigated the sub
          ject.
          He claims that hypnotism has no le
          gitimate place in criminal jurisprudence
          and while he concedes "that a criminal
          hypnotist in control of a criminal sub
          ject could undoubtedly procure the
          commission of a crime under excep
          tionally favorable circumstances," ha
          illustrates that it practically in such a
          case could not be a legal defense on the
          ground—first, because in the nature of
          things a hypnotized subject can have
          no standing in a court of justice as a
          witness, and, second, because the cross
          examination of a subject as to the na
          ture and extent of the sugegstions
          made to him by a hypnotist would be
          quite impossible and absurd.
          The psychological section is now 'de
          voting itself to the examination of hyp
          notism. Its January meeting was de
          voted to clinical work.
          Hypnotism Interposed as a defense In
          criminal eases by an accused person
          must always be regarded with distrust.
          The question before the courts will
          always be one of fact for the jury:
          (a) Was the accused in the condition
          known as the hypnotic trance or state?
          (b) Was his mind under the control
          or domination of the hypnotizer?
          (c) Did the accused, at the time of
          the act, know of the nature, character
          and effect of his act, or was his act
          i used by the domination and will of
          the hypnotizer. either in conscious or
          unconscious states?
          A jury must be made to believe that
          the act was done wholly without con
          scious knowledge of the act, or that his
          will was absolutely under the control
          and domination of the hypnotizer, and
          that he had not the power to resist that
          control to affect the question of re
          sponsibility.
          This contribution is made as due to
          the importance and urgency of the
          question of how far hypnotic sugges
          lion is a legitimate factor in determin

          AND PNEUMONIA.
          Grip ha? become epidemic in the
          city, one school reports every child
          as having been afflicted.
          Tho disease is not confined to the
          children. Grown upu are suffering
          headaches, sore throats, heavy eyes
          and fever.
          There is nothing alarming in the
          malady, except thai enp frequently
          lays the foundation for pneumonia.
          At the annual session of physician
          in Mew York on Tuesday, reference
          was made to new types of pneumonia
          developed last winter and also to the
          larce number of cases of the disease
          in the army. An Ogden physician says
          the pneumonia which has been follow
          ing grip in the east is difficult to diag
          nose and does not readily yield to
          treatment.

          ought to worry the Kaiser, as
          much as the Spanish germ.
          Those ninety-two ships will

          Second, to see to it that the

          th& Children. have high wages to
          pay the preserikhiKh cost of liv

          to have a few extra tens of mil

          sons.
          Third, arrange when the war is
          over to take care of the fighting
          men that come back providing
          for needs of the wounded, so that
          they need never worry.

          ernment building of roads, canals,
          draining of swamps and irrigat

          scientists to study that Spanish
          Influenza, its causes, the possibility
          of fighting It, and especially of
          keeping it out of the United States.
          It Is known that John D. Rocke
          feller's Idea, which controls his
          son in the use of the Rockefeller
          fortune. Is to spend money FOR
          PREVENTION rather than for the
          cure of individual cases. Not to
          cure one or a thousand sick peo
          ple, but to find a way to prevent
          millions in future from catching
          disease that Is the Rockefeller
          idea.
          Investigation of this strange dis
          ease In Europe, sending some of
          the Rockefeller scientists, gather
          ed from all over the world, Japan,
          France and elsewhere, would be a
          step in the line of prevention.
          Later, having identified the
          germ, probably one of those little
          things that look like a colled
          spring, now circulating rapidly In
          the Kaiser's blood, Mr. Rockefeller
          might put up a small monument to
          It with this label, "Germ of the
          Spanish influenza disease, much
          enlarged. This monument built
          Br a grateful Rockefeller, to the
          germ that made the Kaiser tired
          or irar.

          VICTIM IN CAPITAL
          Outbreak of "Spanish" influenza
          among Washington's civilian popula
          tion was revealed today when the
          first fatal case had been reported to
          the District Health Office. Every
          precaution has been taken to prevent
          a spread of the malady, and warning
          Is given against undue alarm.
          The first District man to succumb
          to the disease Is John W. Clore,
          twenty-four years old, of 1103 -Florida

          cases have been reported.

          WASHINGTON, D. O. Sept. 27.
          Spanish influenza, sweeping
          through all but 1 of the army camps
          and apparently beyond control in
          many eastern communities, has caused
          a tremendous increase In the death
          rate of the army at home.
          For the week ending Septem
          ber 20. the surgeon general's of
          fice reported today, the death
          rate was 4.4 per cent, compared
          with 23 per cent the preceding
          week.
          This Increase was attributed in
          large measures to influenza, but the
          report pointed out that the figures
          do not show the seriousness of the
          situation as since last Friday there
          has been a farther rapid spread of
          the epidemic with many deaths.
          The surgeon general's office
          said the epidemic may be expect
          ed to sweep westward with a still
          greater Increase In mortality In
          the next few weeks.'
          Orders issued last night by pro
          vost marshal general Crowder can
          celling calls for entrapment of 142,
          00 draft registrants between October
          7 and 11 were due to the serious con
          ditions in many camps and were said
          by health officials to be absolutely
          necessary at this time.

          Germany, Having Been Communicated by Soldiers oa Leave or Returning Wounded.
          Making Jts Way Through Prisoners Into France, It Followed, Through Causes Not
          Yet Known, a Well-Marked line Into Spain, Where It Increased in VIrulency and
          Gained Its Name. From Spain It Returned Again to France, from Whence It Was Car
          ried by Infected Persons on Ships Both to England and to America. Its Transmission
          Into the Scandinarian Neutral Countries, Where It Has Claimed Many Lives, Seems
          to Hare Been by Way of Belgium and Holland.
          By Dr. Gordon Henry
          THE first really serious epidemic of
          disease produced by the great war
          is that called "the Bpaniah Influ
          enza" which has caused deplorable mor
          tality In New York and New England.
          At the outset It should be said that the
          term "Spanish infiuenxa" Is clearly an
          error, and that the name should be "Ger
          man Influenza," for Investigation proves
          that the disease originated In the German
          trenches. It has since made a tour ot the
          entire civilized world, In the course ot
          which It broke out with especial severity
          in Spain, owing to certain local conditions.
          The French, noting Its ravages in Spain,
          and not having suffered very badly them
          selves, gave It the title "Spanish Influ-
          ua"
          That this should be the only epidemic
          disease produced by the world war Is a
          remarkable proof of the protection afforded
          to ns. by modern medicine and hygiene.
          After nearly all other great wars, as a re
          sult ot the misery, starvation and enfeeble
          ment of the population, there have been
          great outbreaks of pestilence, which have
          depopulated cities and even countries.
          The disease generally known as "the
          bubonic plague" is the great plague which
          caused the great ravages of past war
          epochs, its cost in human lives has not
          been less than two billions. In addition, out
          breaks of smallpox, cholera, typhus and
          yellow fever have followed debilitating
          wars.
          Fortunately our enormous progress in
          medicine and our material resources for
          combating disease give assurance that no
          plague epidemic of such magnitude as
          those ot the past can orcur in America at
          the present time.
          How widespread has been the outbreak
          of Spanish Influenza Is shown by the fact
          that our Assistant Secretary of the Navy,
          Franklin D. Roosevelt, suffered from it,
          while, at about the time he was recovering
          the youngest son of the King of Sweden
          died of it.
          The first known advent of the influenza
          In this country occurred when the Nor
          wegian ship Bergensfjord arrived at New
          York on August 12 with twenty-five cases,
          three ot whom died, but there were prob
          ably other sources of infection, apart from
          the report that the German U-boats sur
          reptitiously disseminated the Infection in
          this country. Independent sources of in
          fection, apparently, reached Boston and
          New England, where the disease raged
          most alarmingly, causing seventy deaths
          in one day and 9.000 cases at the Camp
          Devens military camp.
          And now just what happens to the suf
          ferer from Spanish Influenza? From obser
          vations ot one thousand soldiers It was
          found that from one to three days after
          contact or approach to others who had Ibo
          disease a feverish state began This fever
          rose steadily until on the second or third
          day afterwards, it was as high as occurs
          in pneumonia. In many cases it went as
          high at 104 deg. Fahr. Indeed, it is ap
          parent that one of the most common as
          well as the most dangerous complications
          is that ot pneumonia.
          The disease starts with a chill or chills
          that may shake the whole room you're in
          Severe headaches, with pains in the legs,
          In the groin. In the neck, in the spine, and
          in the small of the back are generally
          present
          Then "that tired feeling." named by doc
          tors "general malaise," takes charge of the
          safferer'a anatomy The Ictlm feels
          wretched all over Fever blisters, those
          frequent accompaniments of pneumonia, of
          meningitis and of tertian malaria, "break
          jut" on the sufferer's lips.
          The face becomes flushed, a thermom
          eter stuck under the tongue registers 102
          to 104 degroes. and the victim as well as
          his doctors knows he's in for it badly.
          Spanish influenza "cures or kills" in
          Liberty motor speed. Within four days the
          worst Is usually over. About the second
          day the abrupt crisis takes place. On the
          fourth day the patient is either as well as
          he ever was, or pneumonia or another com
          plication asserts its dangerous presence.
          A harsh cough is a frequently encountered

          symptom. The patient thus hacks and
          sprays forth lots of the microbes, which
          spread the infection rapidly unlcBs handlod
          with the greatest precaution.
          A thick, tenacious sputum of a whitish
          mucoid character distinguishes this new
          disease from the well-known old influenza
          with its greenish sputum. This also dis
          tinguishes Spanish Influenza from pneumo
          nia, with Its typical "rusty colored tough
          expectoration."
          Failure of Intestinal action, a restricted
          flow of the kidney fluids and a want of
          appetite rlay a large role In the charac
          teristic signs and symptoms ot Spanish
          Influenza.
          If you take close notice of the several
          differences between this new malady and
          the old influenza, you will observe that the
          fever Is sharper, higher, but of shorter
          duration; the total course of the new
          scourge Is briefer; thero are fewer stomach
          or intestinal Bymptoms in the Spanish
          influenza, whereas in the previously known
          influenza gastro-Intestinal disturbances
          were predominant.
          A most important discovery has just
          been made nith regard to this disease
          The specific microbe which causes It has
          been definitely isolated. This is a complete
          disproof of the assertion In some medical
          publications that the bacillus was the
          same as that of the old influenza, or grip.
          This Interesting discovery Is due to the
          researches of three English army sur
          geons. Captains T. R. Little, C. J. Garafalo
          and P. A. Williams, ot the Canadian Mo
          bile Bacteriological Laboratory, attached
          to the British base hospitals.
          The last great pandemic of grip, or in
          fluenza, lasted threo years, from 1889 until
          1892. It spread like wildfire over the
          civilized world during that period. Then
          several American bacteriologists at work
          simultaneously and Professor Pfeiffer dis
          covered the grip germ, or influenza bacil
          lus, which has since been confirmed and
          established as the specific cause of the
          colds, pains, backaches and other classical
          symptoms of the old-time grip.
          The present scourge, it was soon found,
          is much more malignant and entirely dif
          ferent from the other
          The manner in which the bacterial agent
          which causes this plague was run to earth
          is a model of the bacteriological skill, su
          premacy, efficiency and patience of the
          English and American medical staffs.
          It was recognized that the rapidity with
          which the contagion spread pretty well
          pointed to some microbe or bacterium as
          the guilty party. It was also argued that
          the causative agent must lurk at least a
          large part of the time in or near the air
          passages of the victim.
          The coughs, the sputum tho pneumonia
          and bronchitis complications, the spray
          from the nose and throat as it came in
          direct contact with the men or reached
          them through plates, dishes and linens,
          seemed to Invito bacteriological searches
          and microscopic studies
          Fortunately, for all of us on thlb side of
          the ocean, medical science has mcceeded in
          Isolating and Identifying the germs in just
          that way at the very beginning of the
          American epidemic, which is thereforo like
          ly to be nipped in the bud.
          The new bacillus is not in tho blood.
          Cultivation ot It Is impossible from this
          source It Is lucky that so demoniacal a
          bug does not penetrate thf delicate fluid
          tissue of man. Then Its malignancy
          would perhaps be tenfold.
          However, when the bacteriologists ex
          plored the discharges and excretions from
          the nose, the pharynx and the throat, lo
          nnd behold! their pioneer work was at
          last rewarded.
          Spread upon glass and examined under
          a magnification of 1,200 times, a new
          microscopic living world opened up before
          their astonished gaze
          A veritable beehive of trembling, vibrat
          ing bacilli almost as round and as small
          and resembling tho dlplococcus of menlngi
          lis loomed up beneath tho high magnlflca
          tions of the microscope. A dlplococcus is
          a type of microbe In which two disc-like
          hhapes are attached to one another.
          At the poles or opposing ends of this
          myriad of tiny germs their torpedo, blunt
          noses were flattened out to make them al
          most biscuit shaped.

          Entirely Doing Away with Danger
          of Communicating the Infection.
          In no "smears" of these bacteria were
          there any ot the well-known Pfeiffer bacilli
          of influenza or any double cocci ot pneu
          monia. The newly discovered germ has charac
          teristics peculiarly Its own. These are de
          scribed in technical reports In the London
          Lancet for July and the British Medical
          Journal tor August 10, 1918.
          As a rule there are so many bacteria that
          are superficially at first glance exactly
          alike that a mere Inspection nf them un
          dyed or unstained under the microscope
          without planting them In various small test
          tubes of different soils would fool even ex
          perts into believing that they are similar
          and Identifiable.
          On this account It is that bacteriologists
          must use a great many other teBts to con
          vince themselves and their skeptical con
          freres and enemies tbat they have a new
          and a different germ.
          It Is done in this way. When they And
          and isolate a bacterium and under the
          microscope it resembles even when
          stained blue or otherwise, dyed the dlplo
          cocci of pneumonia or meningitis both of
          which also look alike they "put iodine on
          Its' tall," as It were. If It "takes" it Is thus
          differentiated into one of two groups which
          take or do not take iodine.
          Then it Is planted In gelatine. It either
          grows and melts the gelatine or It does
          not. Thus another group Is found.
          Then potato, moss, agar, banana, blood
          serum and other soils are used until a
          whole series of facts are found about a
          germ which show it to be different from all
          hitherto discovered ones.
          Thus it is with the new germ. The med
          ical gentlemen determined that it has
          none of the earmarks of any bacillus; that
          has ever been "brought into captivity."
          This bacillus we have found grows with
          extreme reluctance upon the various
          "media" or Jlelds on which most other
          micro-organisms thriie. It hankers after
          blood. It thrives and grows best on blood
          serum media, although it does not grow
          In the human blood
          There is a luxuriant, rich, abundant
          sprouting of tho malicious bacillus In this
          serum soil, which explains why Spanish in
          fluenza clings so tenaciously to the lips,
          the tongue, the mouth and the gums ot its
          victims and its "carriers."
          The physicians and. scientists of the
          Allied countries are, seriously considering
          whether or not the germs of this disease
          have been intentionally disseminated by
          the German Government with the Inten
          tion of weakening their opponents. No
          definite conclusion has been reached on
          this point, but the charge canot be hastily
          dismissed, os tho German Government has
          already been convicted of employing dis
          ease germs against civilians In Rumania.
          Tho disease was first observed by army
          doctors to bo raging in the German
          trenches on the Flanders front in the wet
          weather of last Spring. From the front
          It passed to the weakened interior imputa
          tion of Germany with great severity. It
          then broke out in Spain, and as the French
          civilians first noticed its ravages there
          they called it Spanish influenza. It Is sig
          nificant that Intercourse between Germany
          and Spain by U-boat and in other ways
          has been particularly frequent From
          these two centres its world-wide, spread
          has started.

          Facts About "Spanish Influenza9 and
          How to Protect Yourself Against It
          THE disease begins two or three
          days after infection with fever,
          heavy sneezing, headache, aching
          bones and general pains.
          All colds with high fever should be put
          to bed and the doctor called.
          Infection is mostly caused by reck
          less sneezing, coughing and spitting.
          Avoid these practices and those who
          have them.
          To guard against infection, keep the
          mouth and nose clean with a mild anti
          septic wash (see accompanying article).
          Medical treatment consists of rest,
          abundant food, aperients, and quinine,
          with Dover powders to stop pain.
          The disease started in the German
          trenches, passed to Spain and then
          spread over the civilized world.
          Tbat the influenza germs have been se
          cretly scattered in this country by German
          U-boats is a charge difficult to prove, but
          their gas attacks on crows of our light
          ships and lighthouses furnish character
          evidence against them.
          It Is scientifically demonstrated that the
          germs Increase in virulence with the num
          ber ot persons they pass throngh, until
          finally tho system acquires immunity
          against them through infection.
          Treatment for tho disease is simple.
          Surgeon-General Blue, of the Public
          Health Service, summarizes it as follows:
          "Rest In bed, fresh air, abundant food,
          free action of intestines, with Dover's
          powder for tho relief of pain. Every caso
          with fever should ho regarded as serious
          and kept in bed."
          In order to guard against Infection It
          Is necessary to keep the mouth and noso
          clean and healthy by means of some mild
          antiseptic and to treat all colds promptly.

          Canadian army doctors have found
          that Spanish influenza is caused by a
          new, hitherto unrecognized bacillus,

          tion, unless" careful treatment with rest
          in bed be given.
          Medical measures already taken will
          make it impossible for the Spanish in
          fluenza to become a serious menace to
          the health of the army.
          An accusation that the disease has
          been intentionally disseminated by Ger
          man U-boats is being investigated by
          medical authorities.
          The first identified case reached the
          United States in a Norwegian ship on
          August 31.
          be found very useful in keeping nose and
          throat clean.
          The disease is spread by "droplet infec
          tion," that is, by little drops swarming
          with germs scattered by infected persons
          who sneeze, spit and cough In public
          places. Ono sneeze in a street car may
          Infect a whole city.
          It is therefore very comforting to know
          that Health Commissioner Copeland, ot
          New York, hascalled a meeting of theatri
          cal managers and others with a view to
          enforcing tho laws against spitting in
          public.
          Kissing is another prolific method of In
          fection, and this practice should be stopped
          except In cases where it is absolutely In
          dispensable to happiness. Kissing between
          members ot the gentle sex can certainly
          be abolished without hardship.
          Army doctors have found the "gauze face
          mask" very useful In preventing infection.
          This is made with three or four layers of
          gauze In the shape of a rectangle Ave by
          seven Inches, covering the mouth and
          nose and secured by a band over the ears
          and round the back of the head.

          Quarantine Is Lifted
          The ban is off, yet the danger is not
          over, and I kindly ask every one to join in
          a campaign to keep this influenza under the
          same stringent submission you would the
          Kaiser, for just as surely it will get you as
          the Kaiser, if you give it a chance.
          There will be services at the various
          churches Sunday, but if you are not feeling
          well stay at home for your own protection
          as well as that of others.
          The schools will open Monday. Watch
          your children carefully and if they are not
          well by all means keep them at home.
          Theaters, lodges and pool rooms will
          also begin operations Monday and we hope
          within the next few weeks to see Pullman
          the same busy, happy little city she was
          before this awful epidemic struck us.

          Influenza And 'The Mask.
          x
          The above is a chart showing Svhen the Influenza
          started in Logan and how it hits acled since, with refer
          ence to the total number of cases in :he city each day, the
          total number of places in quarantine and the total nuinber
          of deaths which have occurred. !From this chart the
          condition for any day can readily, be' determined. For'
          example takehe 21st day'of November. The chart shows
          that there was a total of 123. cases, and a total of 97 homes
          in quarantine in the entire city on that day. The death
          curve shows that there had been five deaths from the dis
          ease up to that date, but that on the 21st two more deaths
          occurred making a total of seven.
          Until the 16th day of November there had been only
          one or two cases of the disease developed in the business
          district of the city, but upon that date there was ten or
          twelve cases developed in the business houses on Main
          street. It therefore became evident to the board of health
          that further precautions would have to be taken if an
          incerased rapid spread of the disease was curtailed. An
          ordinance was therefore passed on the 18th, becoming
          effective on the 20th, making the universal wearing of
          gauze masks compulsory.
          It will be rioted from the chart that there was a rapid
          increase of cases and quarantines for four days after the
          mask was put into use or until the 24th day of November,
          at which time the masks apparently began to become ef
          fective. Since that date the story is told by the chart.
          From the 24th day of November until the 11th day of De
          cember, a period of seventeen days, the total number of
          cases in the city dropped from 136 to 13, and the total
          number of homes quarantined from 105 to 10. Nearly all
          the cases which have developed since the 11th have come
          in from out of town.
          The Logan Board" of Health feels that the masks were
          put on the public just at the, time when a severe epidemic
          was just getting started and that' they have not only
          saved the public from an extreme Condition of the disease
          and saved many lives, but that they have practically
          stamped out the epidemic here.
          That the epidemic had reached its severest stage from
          about the 16th to the 24th is not only clearly shown by the
          "Case" and the Quarantine" curves, but it is indicated
          by the number of deaths which occurred between the 21st
          and 24th inclusive, as shown by the death curve. Ten
          deaths occurred between these dates out. of a total of six
          teen deaths in the city from the disease. The masks were
          put on, without' question, at the beginning of the most
          critical time of the epidemic. Four of the cases which
          died in Logan contracted the disease elsewhere and were
          brought here suffering from pneumonia.
          This, chart does ont represent or include the condition
          which existed at the Utah Agricultural College The Col
          lege was under' the supervision of military officials and
          not under the supervisison of the Qity Board of Health.
          There was 234 cases of influenza which went thwugh
          the hospjtal at the College and atotal of six deaths occur
          red there. The disease was entirely wiped out there some
          four or five weeks ago. The doctors who had the disease
          in charge at the college claim that they wiped it out by the
          compulsory wearing o masks In infected baritacks the
          boys werp put to sleep with the masks on.
          In conclusion it might be said that comparing Logan
          with most oiher cities of the same size, we e apparent
          ly rather fortunate in not having, more cases of influen
          za. While the mask has been the chief factor in control-

          said ten thousand nurses would be re- tic

          against sending patients to hospitals. 1

          teriologists and pathologists this evening fit
          to discuss the advisability of using various
          vaccines to combat influenza. No

          ffl.'
          Mindful that the influenza epidemic that
          ravaged the cotntry last winter was tit
          ,brought from Europe aboard a vessel ar- nc
          riving at Boston, port health authorities wf
          m<
          yesterday were prompt in their action
          when five cases of influenza were discovered
          among the passengers of the Lorraine,
          of the French line, which arrived
          here. The persons afflicted were taken to m(
          Swinburne Island and placed In the isolation
          hospital.
          Dr. Royal S. Copeland, Health Commis- Nl
          doner, repeated emphatically that there 'ffc
          fs no epidemic of "flu'' in the city so fat of
          this winter. The number of cases in the
          in vjirimis stages, is under the five st<
          hundred mark?less than the number for by
          11*3 same period in 1917, the year before N?
          the epidemic, he said. The day by day be:
          figures showed ninety cases for Sunday
          and Monday, and fifty-nine cases for Sat- a
          urday. Pneumonia eases were lit? for Sun-
          day and Monday and I'M for Saturday.
          "At this time in the city, there i* nothing
          at all in the nature of an influenza
          ^epidemic," Dr. Oopeland said. "We have i
          always had influenza and pneumonia cases sp
          and deaths at this season of the year. ?r
          During' the last epidemic New York city
          had about one million cases of influenza. on
          and in consequence, I think. *wc have a m<
          ertain degree of immunity from the disease
          now. This city then had the lowest
          death rate of any of the principal cities Af
          of the country. Our Health Department is rai
          the best in the country, and I attribute this rni
          to the fact that out* employes are under
          efrll service, and most of them have been
          In the department a great many years." erf
          The spread of influenza in Toland, he to
          emmented, was due no doubt to the poor JV1
          economic conditions of the populace.
          Dr. Copeiond said that the Health De'

          "The age grouping, as shown in the
          nortality of the first week of the present I
          pldemle, does not coincide exactly with
          he age grouping effect in the pan-j
          pidemlc of the year 1918," said Dr. Cope-
          and.
          "The group most affected in the epl-;
          lemic or 1018 was the group or age rrom
          .wenty-five to forty-five, nt the beginning:
          >f which tins group represented fortyvvo

          lined.
          "In the epidemic of 1918 the ace croup i
          fifteen to twenty-five years represented!
          it the commencement of the epidemic i
          tw?ntv-flve per cent of all deaths from'
          nfliionzn and pneumonia combined and;
          rrnduallv decreased as the epidemic pro-j
          ,-ressed to fifteen per rent.
          "The age group under five years of ace!
          n the epidemic of 1918 started at a per-j
          entage of fourteen and gradually rose to
          i percentage of twenty-one. During ttmi
          present epidemic this age group started
          rery much higher, with a percentage of j
          twenty-six. It is likely that the prevailing
          epidemic of measles has affected this ace;
          croup considerably and increased the mortality
          from the pneumonias nmong infants.
          "The ace group forty-five to sixty-five
          remained fairly low at the beginning in,
          the epidemic of 1918 with a percentage of
          twelve, ending with a percentage of
          eleven. During the last week this age
          croup represented seventeen per cent, a
          much higher rate than in tho epidemic of
          1915.
          "At sixty-five years and over the percentage
          of mortality in the epidemic ot
          1918 was considerably below the normal
          and was so maintained during the entire
          epidemic, the percentage at tlie beginning
          of the enidemlc belrVg a little over three
          per cent and it maintained that for at least
          eight consecutive v.eeks, when it rose to
          seven per cent. During the present epidemic,
          however, there lias lieen a very
          much increased mortality In tills age
          group, as during the last week the percentage
          of mortality was thirteen, as compared
          with a normal of three per cent during
          the epidemic of 1918.
          "The last age group to be considered,
          five to fifteen, maintained a fairly normal
          continuous percentage of slightly over five
          per cent during the epidemic of 1918. Jn
          tho present epidemic it was five per oer.t,
          so that, apparently, so far as we are able
          to judge at the present time, the school
          children are not affected, such being t'he
          same condition during the epidemic of

          1D7 nurses of the normal staff, but declared
          that number far below the number or
          nurses required for work owing to the
          epidemic. He said that In response to j
          appeals of physicians of the various hospi-j
          tals he was endeavoring to obtain at least
          fifty additional nurses to help out in the
          care of Influenza and pneumonia cases.
          Dr. Copeland. in talking about the statistics
          compiled from reports of cases, declared
          that the low death rate for the j
          twenty-four hours was significant when J
          compared with the death rate for the same I
          day in the epidemic In 1918. He said that
          although he expected an increase in the
          number of influenza cases this morning,
          lie believed the death rate will reveal a
          similar drop.
          Dr. Copeland said there is not the same
          amount of distress attendant on the epidemic
          this year that characterized that of
          1918. He attributed that to the fact that
          there are a greater number of physicians
          in the city to haDdle the epidemic, hundreds
          of whom were with the armed forces
          at the time of the previous epidemic. The
          increase in the number of hospitals to care
          for victims of litis years epidemic, he said,
          also was a telling factor in the low death
          rate.
          The Health Commissioner said that while
          the hospitals of the city as well as the
          Health Department, were far short of their
          quota of nurses, U3 nurses were obtained
          during the day. Ninety-five of them were j
          untrained, or practical nurses, he said, and!
          rr-jintvl nnrsies.
          "We supplied 153 nurses on calls received
          by the Health Department today," he said
          "The department, however. Is fifty behind
          in the number of calls received for nurses.
          "To facilitate the work of supplying
          nurses as quickly as possible, tine Health
          Department is in direct communication by
          telephone with the headquarters of the
          Ked Cross and the Henry Street Settlement.
          adjuncts of the central nurse service
          in this department.
          "I received letters today from several
          nurses who declared that the compensation
          of $6 a day offered by the city for
          graduate nurses Is far below the amount
          being paid to such nurses in private cases.
          In some instance, the nurses declared,
          they are receiving as high as $12 a day.
          "Of course, that, is considerable of a difference,
          but nurses should understand
          they have a duty to perform to the public,
          in eases where we send nurses to private
          cases where the family can afford to pay

          "The people of the city should pay no

          the Commissioner. "We do not recommend
          the use of disinfectants. We only
          want people to fash their faces and hand*

          S. A. Lewisohxf, of the Mayor's Committee
          on Rent Profiteering, conferred with
          Dr. Copeland about the largo number of
          evictions of tenants which are going on
          despite the epidemic.
          "Mr. Lewisohn agreed with me," aaid
          Dr. Copeland, "that eviction of families

          Mayor's Committee intends to avail Itself
          of every moral and legal means to prevent
          landlords from evicting people during the
          epidemic."
          Reports received from the Department
          of Education reveal there, are few absences
          of school children owing to the epidemic.
          Dr. Copeland said he sent a letter
          during the day to Dr. William L?. Ettlnper.
          City Superintendent of Schools, amplifying
          instructions to the teachers in the
          daily inspection of the children during
          the epidemic. He said that no child who
          has been excluded from the school because
          of Illness will be readmitted without a certificate
          signed by an inspector or a nurse
          of the Department of Health.
          Teachers are instructed to see that the
          children hold handkerchiefs in front a>f
          their faces when coughing or sneezijl:
          No child, he declared, will be permitted to
          use a pencil or other utensil belonging
          to another child, and special attention
          must be paid to the ventilation of the
          class rooms.
          Dr. Copeland said that every member of
          the police force Is on the alert foreepitters.
          He said that a great many people believe
          they may expectorate in the streets, but
          that Is a mistake. The law declares, he
          said, that spitting in any public place 1?
          taboo. To avoid arrest, he said, persons
          suffering from colds had better use their
          handkerchiefs on all occasions.
          At the request of the HeaJth Commie
          sloner the Community Councils of Oreater
          New York communicated with fifty councils
          in the city urging them to become active
          in the fight on the epidemic. Members
          of the councils are requested to supply
          as much food as possible for the poor,
          as well as volunteer help and automobile*.
          To expedite the work of the councils they
          have been assigned to individual rones,
          working from a headquarters in a aettlernent
          house.
          Robert Barr, of the Raymond Street Jan.
          Rrooklyn, placed two hundred prisoners
          under quarantine as a precautionary measure.
          Only three, he said, are ill and none
          is suffering from influenza. There are
          nineteen women prisoners in his charge.

          Although there was a marked increase
          vaaterd&y in the number of influenza cases
          reported to the Health Department. Dr.
          Royal S. Copeland, Health Commissioner,
          declared tha figures did not indicate a
          return of the epidemic of last year. There
          were 462 casts reported during the day.
          aa compared with 140 reported on Tuesday.
          He said there also was an increase in the
          number of pneumonia cases, 230 being reported,
          as against 120 for the day before.
          "There is nothing alarming in the increased
          number of cases of either disease,"
          he said. "The figures merely bear out our
          prediction there would be a return of the
          disease this year. Ail of the oases of influenza,
          fortunately, aro of a milder type
          than those of lust year, and are ot shorter
          duration.
          "The influenza germ, it would appear,
          has worn out its virulence and the disease
          Is less frequently followed by secondary
          pneumonia, indoor life Is responsible
          for the spread of the influenza germ this
          year. People have not riven their homes
          sufficient ventilation since the beginning
          of the winter and the diseas" gets a foothold
          in that way.
          "While we are not worried in the least
          by the increase in the number of cases
          reported, at the same time we are arranging
          to handle the situation in the
          event the number of cases increases," explained
          Dr. Copeland.
          "Wo have installed at the headquarters
          of the Health Department a separate telenhone
          system, where a special staff of
          clerks will receive calls for nurses and

          "We want the names and addresses of
          nurses and persons having a practical experience
          in nursing. however, so as to
          enpe with the disease In the event of an
          epidemic. We feci that every person who
          has had nursing experience should make
          a personal sacrifice by giving up other
          activities to aid us in-the event we need

          "The short a ge of nurses In the ijty Is
          imazing." said Dr Copeiand. "In view of

          because we have 1.000 beds In well organized

          INFLUENZA DATA
          Puerto Rico Epidemic and
          “Devil’s Grippe's” Out
          break Lead to Queries.
          BY THOMAS R. HENRY.
          Is there a prospect of a coming
          “flu Winter”?
          The Public Health Service Is begin
          ning to get inquiries from health of
          ficers seeking the basis of an opinion
          which evidently is becoming wide
          spread among private practitioners
          all over the country that the stage is I
          set for another outbreak of influenza
          with cold weather.
          The case as it stands is:
          During August and early September
          there was a rather widespread in
          flucnza epidemic in Puerto Rico.
          During the past month along the
          Atlantic Seaboard, and especially in
          Virginia and North Carolina, there
          has been an epidemic of a curious
          malady known as "Devil’s grippe,” an
          Intestinal malady regarded as closely
          related to. If not identical with, the
          dreaded influenza.
          Dormant for Four Years.
          The influenza virus has been dor
          mant tor the past four years and some
          believe that it is about time for it
          to wake up again.
          There is no basis for making any
          positive predictions from these facts,
          Public Health Service officials claim.
          The most serious is the Puerto Rico
          epidemic, which has included several
          thousand cases, although there has
          been no increase in the island's death
          rate and apparently the cases have
          been without serious after effects—
          the most serious part of a flu epidemic.
          The history of past influenza out
          breaks. however, has been that they
          atart from some such focus and arc
          confined at first in fairly restricted
          areas, from which they break along
          the path of least resistance.
          The last major epidemic was that of
          1928. Cases were being reported from
          Hawaii at least a month before the
          disease appeared on the Pacific Coast,
          from which it made rapid progress
          across the country. If the Puerto
          Rico epidemic spreads it would be
          expected to follow one of two courses
          ■—to the coast of Florida and up the
          Atlantic coastline, or through the
          Panama Canal Zone to the West
          Coast. The greatest anxiety appears
          to be felt in California, which has ex
          perienced a serious epidemic of poly
          omyelitis or infantile paralysis, this
          Bummer.
          Little Known of Malady.
          The "Devil’s grippe” relationship to
          Influenza is largely conjectural and
          very little is known about this ob
          scure malady. It is not one of the
          reportable diseases. The fact that
          there has been an epidemic of it is
          known to the Public Health Service
          only through inquiries from newspa
          pers. reports of visitors to the Wash
          ington office from affected areas, and
          possibly exaggerated reports current
          among private practitioners. It Is
          said that an epidemic of this malady
          has preceded each of the past great
          influenza waves, but there is no sta
          tistical evidence to prove this. The
          disease, in fact, has been known to
          medical science for only about 20
          years.
          Devil’s grippe may be a Summer
          form of influenza itself. It is so re
          garded by many physicians. An at
          tack Is seldom fatal or followed by
          complications, although It may leave
          the victim in a weakened condition
          and hence more easily subject to
          other infections. It Is one of the many
          Alterable virus diseases. Influenza it
          self is another. It never has been
          possible to isolate the virus. The two
          may be the same, or they may differ
          enough to be classified as separate
          maladies.
          Since the great inuenza epidemics
          of war time, medical laboratories the
          world over have worked intensively on
          the problem of the origin and means
          of prevention of the disease, but act
          ually very little progress has been
          made. Because erf the general feeling
          among doctors that an epidemic is
          likely this Winter, whether supported
          by reliable evidence or not, it is ex
          pected that an especially sharp watch
          will be kept out for it everywhere.
          Tend to Lose Violence.
          Nothing can be predicted. Public
          Health Sendee officials claim, as to
          the seriousness of such an epidemic.
          If it does come. The history of the
          Alterable virus diseases, however, has
          been that they tend to lose virulence
          with each succeeding crest until they
          apparently disappear almost com
          pletely and may remain dormant for
          many years before there Is another
          major outbreak. Thus the 1928 epi
          demic was much less serious than
          those of the war years and, If the rule
          holds, the next one will be less serious
